\chapter{Outlook}\label{chap:Outlook}
\maketitle

In this chapter, it would be great to talk to everyone you know (Witek, Samuel, Jhilam, Nicolas, Michal, and so on) to get a better feel for what kinds of issues need to be addressed next. You've already got sort of a rudimentary understanding (see your Google Keep note for starters), but it might be good to get some outsider perspective. This will be especially important as you start looking for postdocs, and \textit{especially} especially if you end up looking for postdocs in nuclear theory, but not necessarily nuclear fission.

As I said in chapter \ref{chap:Intro}, ``Finally, in chapter \ref{chap:Outlook} we discuss the current state of the field, and, based on our experience, offer insights for guiding future developments in the field.''
