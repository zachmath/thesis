\section{Review, outlook, and perspectives}

In this chapter, it would be great to talk to everyone you know (Witek, Samuel, Jhilam, Nicolas, Michal, and so on) to get a better feel for what kinds of issues need to be addressed next. You've already got sort of a rudimentary understanding (see your Google Keep note for starters), but it might be good to get some outsider perspective. This will be especially important as you start looking for postdocs, and \textit{especially} especially if you end up looking for postdocs in nuclear theory, but not necessarily nuclear fission.

As I said in chapter \ref{chap:Intro}, ``Finally, in chapter \ref{chap:Outlook} we discuss the current state of the field, and, based on our experience, offer insights for guiding future developments in the field.''

At this stage, we have techniques to calculate half-lives and primary fragment distributions (I haven't mentioned it yet, but there is also Nicolas' method for the fragment yields that uses TD-GCM. Are there others? What about for half-lives?). Some methods (such as Walid's, TDDFT, and possibly also this GCM method) are starting to estimate fragment energetics (kinetic and excitation energies). Down the line, there are others who try to predict neutron multiplicities and goodness knows what else using Hauser-Feshbach models and such (FREYA and more). These regions are still disconnected. Of course, these methods still need major refinements in order to better reflect experimental data. Some ideas currently in the pipeline for improving the models are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Improved EDFs (here you could mention the DME EDFs; unfortunately, introducing density-dependence has a bad effect but I forgot what it was)
	\item Improved inertia tensor (such as automatic differentiation)
	\item Better/more collective coordinates (Walid's $D, \xi$ coordinates from \cite{Younes2012}; continuity of the PES in $\infty$-dimensional space such like in David Regnier's talks and papers)
	\item Fragment identification (our localization paper, Marc Verriere's method; you might also mention that this is not an issue in TDDFT, but there you've only got one single fragment pair)
	\item Microscopic/self-consistent description for dissipation. This is the mechanism which exchanges between intrinsic and collective degrees of freedom, but we handle it in a very ad hoc way with parameters which are fitted instead of determined systematically through some theory. Solving this problem will probably help us with the energetics of fragments (TKE and E* at the same time!)
	\item Machine learning for r-process inputs (described in detail in \ref{sect:ml4rprocess})
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, there are more experimental observables that we should try to predict (refer to Andreyev's review to see what other observables can currently be measured). These include energetics (TKE and E*, for we have only begun to scratch the surface here), angular momentum, prompt neutron multiplicities (is that within the scope of these self-consistent models?), prompt neutron and gamma energy spectra spectra (getting harder; these are usually handled via statistical models; see intro to \cite{Schmidt2018} for some references), level densities?, and probably more but my mind is blanking. How to compute these in a self-consistent framework is still an open question. See also the outlook in Nicolas' review.

We definitely need a better handle on the inertia. The perturbative inertia is easy to compute, but not terribly reliable. The non-perturbative inertia can certainly do better, but as it is computed now (using finite differences) it is subject to numerical artifacts and instabilities (dependent on the level of convergence of the individual densities, the coefficient multipliers, different basis sizes) and actual physics, such as level crossings which manifest in projections from a higher-dimensional space.

UNEDF1 seems to underestimate fission barrier heights (artificial though the concept may be; the main impact is probably that lifetimes are underestimated). It also turns out to be a headache to work with, making convergence quite a challenge sometimes (any cases in particular, like for highly-deformed or heavy or octupole-deformed nuclei or something?). Better functionals might hope to better capture the physics, and one can hope they are easier to work with.
