\section{Cluster emission in Superheavy Elements}

The region of superheavy elements (Z>104) is an interesting one for the study of spontaneous fission because the liquid drop model predicts that all isotopes with Z>104 are unstable with respect to spontaneous fission. These nuclei are stabilized due to shell effects, but they nevertheless remain short-lived and many of them will decay by spontaneous fission regardless.

Experimentally, spontaneous fission has been observed from several superheavy isotopes (see the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:karpovshedecay}). Other observed SHEs undergo a series of alpha decays, which chains terminate in spontaneous fission. Furthermore, a variety of models predict regions of spontaneous fission in the superheavy regime. One example is shown in Figure \ref{fig:karpovshedecay}, in which lifetimes were computed for several types of decays using empirical formulas and the results compared to estimate branching ratios. Figure \ref{fig:warda2012she} is similar, except that the spontaneous fission lifetimes were computed microscopically, as were the $Q_\alpha$ values used to estimate alpha decay lifetimes.

cluster emission \cite{Sandulescu1980,Poenaru1986,Royer1998}

From the theoretical point of view, half-life calculations based on semiempirical models predict cluster radioactivity to be the dominant decay channel of several superheavy nuclei~\cite{Poenaru2011, Poenaru2012, Poenaru2013, Poenaru2015, Poenaru2018,Santhosh2018, Zhang2018}. Similar predictions have been obtained by more microscopic calculations using nuclear DFT framework \cite{Warda2011,Warda2018}.

Poenaru and others have predicted in \cite{Poenaru2011, Poenaru2012, Poenaru2013, Poenaru2015, Poenaru2018,Santhosh2018, Zhang2018} that many superheavy elements will decay into two fragments, with the heavy fragment near the doubly-magic nucleus {\Pb}. This particular decay mode is significant enough to have earned its own name in the literature, where it is known variously as cluster emission, cluster radioactivity, or lead radioactivity \cite{Sandulescu1980,Poenaru1986,Royer1998,Poenaru2010}. The phenomenon of cluster emission was first observed in the decay  $^{223}_{\hphantom{2}88}$Ra$\rightarrow$$^{209}_{\hphantom{2}82}$Pb + $^{14}_{\hphantom{1}6}$ \cite{Rose1984} and has since been observed in several actinides. In all cases seen so far, it is a rare event with a small branching ratio \cite{Poenaru2010}.

The mechanism of cluster emission is based on the stability of the doubly-magic nucleus {\Pb}. {\Og} is an excellent candidate for cluster emission because the cluster it is predicted to emit, {\Kr}, receives additional stability due to its having a magic number of neutrons.  Semiemprical arguments based on the symmetry energy lend additional support to this candidate, since {\Og} and {\Pb} have a similar $N/Z$ ratio \cite{Warda2018}.

We took this prediction one step further than the aforementioned by calculating the full spontaneous fission fragment distribution of {\Og}. As we will show, the distribution is sharply-peaked around {\Pb}. Furthermore, the distribution is quite robust with respect to the inputs of the calculations. We will also visualize the formation of the fragments using the nucleon localization function.

\section{Predicted spontaneous fission yields of $^{294}$Og}

We calculated the spontaneous fission fragment yields for {\Og} under a variety of conditions. First, we elected to  using three distinct EDFs: \hfb \cite{Schunck2015}, a Skyrme functional which was optimized to data for spherical and deformed nuclei, including fission isomers; SkM* \cite{Bartel1982}, another Skyrme functional designed for fission barriers and surface energy; and D1S~\cite{Berger1989}, a parameterization of the finite-range Gogny interaction fitted on fission barriers of actinides.

A different collective space was used with each EDF for the tunneling portion of the PES. The {\hfb} calculation was carried out in a four-dimensional collective space consisting of the collective coordinates $(Q_{20}, Q_{30}, Q_{22}, \lambda_2)$. By examining this PES, we were able to reduce to dimensionality of the PES for the other two functionals. The SkM* calculation was performed in a piecewise-continuous space. Between the ground state and the isomer state, $Q_{30}$ does not play a significant role and so the system was described using  $(Q_{20}, Q_{22}, \lambda_2)$. Likewise, $Q_{22} \approx 0$ once the isomer state is reached and reflection symmetry is broken ($Q_{30} \neq 0$), suggesting use of the coordinates  $(Q_{20}, Q_{30}, \lambda_2)$. Finally, for the functional D1S we decided to see how our yields would be affected if we did not consider dynamical pairing fluctuations or axial symmetry breaking at all, in order to drastically reduce computation time. Those calculations were performed in the collective space $(Q_{20}, Q_{30})$.

In the region of Langevin dynamics, which is the region connecting the hypersurface of outer turning points and to the hypersurface of scission points, we found again that $Q_{22} \approx 0$. Consequently, this region was limited to two dimensions $(Q_{20}, Q_{30})$ in all cases.

We start by showing 2-dimensional projections of the calculated PESs in Figure \ref{fig:294ogthreepes}. Although the collective spaces used are different, it is reassuring to see that the surfaces strongly resemble one another. Some common features we highlight are: a symmetric saddle point occurring around $Q_{20}\approx 40$\,b; a second barrier beginning around $Q_{20}\approx100-120$\,b along the symmetric fission path; the presence of local minima at large deformations (marked by stars in the figure); a deep valley that leads to an highly-asymmetric split; and the secondary, less-asymmetric fission valley that emerges at large elongations.

%% This passage is lifted straight from the paper, FYI
But there are  differences as well, such as the height of the first saddle point, the depth of the highly-asymmetric fission valley, and the height of the ridge  separating the two fission valleys. As a result, the outer turning points are pushed to larger elongations in D1S and SkM* as compared to \hfb{}. These differences in the PES topology strongly affect the predicted spontaneous fission half-lives $\tau_\mathrm{SF}$, which in the case of \hfb{}, SkM* and D1S are $9.1\times10^{-9}\,$s, $4.0\times10^{-5}\,$s and $3.2\times10^{-2}\,$s, respectively (see also \cite{Staszczak2013,Baran2015} for a detailed discussion of half-lives). These large variations of $\tau_\mathrm{SF}$ reflect the well-known exponential sensitivity of spontaneous fission half-lives to changes in the quantities entering the collective action \eqref{eq:action}. The $\tau_\mathrm{SF}$ predictions of \hfb{} and, to a lesser degree,  SkM* are incompatible with experiment, as $^{294}$Og  is known to  decay by $\alpha$-decay with a half-life of 0.58\,ms \cite{Brewer2018}. This observation could in fact also apply to the D1S results, since the D1S calculations were performed in a smaller collective space leading to overestimation of the half-lives \cite{Giuliani2014,Sadhukhan2014}. It is to be noted that while half-lives are very sensitive to details of the calculations, the models used here are very consistent with each other and with experiment when it comes to global observables, such as alpha-decay energies, deformations, and radii \cite{Heenen2015,Giuliani2019}. As demonstrated below in Figure \ref{fig:294og3yields}, spontaneous-fission mass and charge yields are also robustly predicted.

\end{figure}

As expected, the yields are peaked in the region of {\Pb} with a sharp fall-off. Likewise, the projected distributions onto the mass and charge axes shows a clear preference for cluster emission, as seen in the top panels of Figure \ref{fig:294ogcompareall}.

\end{figure}

As discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:Model}, the collective inertia can also have a large impact on the fission dynamics. Using the {\hfb} functional, we compared our result with the non-perturbative cranking ATDHFB inertia {\MATDHF} to the perturbative ATDHFB {\MATDHFp} (which appears smoothed-out compared to {\MATDHF}) and perturbative GCM {\MGCMp} (which is smooth and also lower in magnitude than {\MATDHF} or {\MATDHFp} by roughly a factor of 1.5), which are often easier to use for large-scale calculations. The result, shown in the middle panels of Figure \ref{fig:294ogcompareall}, show that the distribution has shifted slightly, but that {\MATDHFp} and {\MGCMp} give identical, or nearly-identical results. The smoothness of the perturbative inertias apparently allow fluctuations to drive the system to more extreme fragment configurations. This suggests that the magnitude of the inertia matters less than the topography for computing fission yields (though we note that this would not be true for calculating half-lives, which depend exponentially on the magnitude of the inertia).

We also vary the strength of fluctuations by adjusting the parameter $\mathbf{\eta}$. Our starting point $\mathbf{\eta}_0$ is taken from reference \cite{Sadhukhan2016}, where it was obtained by adjusting $\mathbf{\eta}$ to match the experimental fragment distribution of $^{294}$Pu. Shown in the bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:294ogcompareall}, we find that fluctuations do not affect the peak of the distribution, consistent with the results of Refs. \cite{Randrup2011,Sierk2017,Sadhukhan2017}. The primary effect is in the tails.

\section{Fragment formation in $^{294}$Og}

The Langevin dynamics approach is useful for calculating total yield distributions, but they do not offer much physical insight into the process of fragment formation. In order to better understand fragment formation for the most-probable fragments, we computed the nucleon localization function (section \ref{sect:locali} and References \cite{Zhang2016,Sadhukhan2017}) along the cluster emission path. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:294oglocali}, where it is compared to the fragments {\Pb} and {\Kr}. We found that the lead prefragment is well-localized as early as just outside the outer turning line. The $N\approx50$ neutrons belonging to krypton are also well-localized, but the $Z\approx36$ protons are not, highlighting the importance of shell effects in prefragment formation.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{TeX_files/294Og_locali}
	\caption[Nucleon localization visualization of $^{294}$Og prefragment formation.]{Nucleon localization functions for several deformed configurations of {\Og}. For comparison, localizations are shown for the fragments {\Pb} and {\Kr} on the left side of each subplot. The configurations shown correspond to Fig. 1 from the paper, with multipole moments $(Q_{20}, Q_{30})=$ (a) (75\,b, 0); (b) (120\,b, 17\,$\mathrm{b}^\frac{3}{2}$); (c) (140\,b, 24\,$\mathrm{b}^\frac{3}{2}$); and (d) (264\,b, 60\,$\mathrm{b}^\frac{3}{2}$).}
	\label{fig:294oglocali}
\end{figure}

In fact, we can leverage this insight to predict fission fragments as early as the outer turning line, resulting in a major reduction in total computing time because of the reduced PES. This is described in Appendix \ref{append:Fragments}.


\section{Experimental efforts to find cluster emission in $^{294}$Og}
Perhaps the biggest uncertainty we'll see, or the biggest deviation from experiment, will be the distribution width. That's because we folded our Langevin results with a Gaussian function, the width of which was chosen rather arbitrarily to be $\sigma_A=6, \sigma_Z=4$. The values used in $^{240}$Pu were 3 and 2, but the $Q_N$ value they used to define scission was quite a bit smaller too. Since we had a much larger $Q_N$ cutoff, we needed to account for larger particle number fluctuations. But these numbers were just kind of arbitrary. I'm not too worried about this because the peak is the part that matters, and we clearly saw a peak at the cluster location.

The effort to detect cluster emission in superheavy elements is already underway. However, one of the biggest challenges standing in the way of observation of cluster emission from {\Og} is the problem of statistics. There have only been 5 recorded instances of {\Og}, from the first observations in 2005 \cite{Oganessian2006} to the most recent in \cite{Brewer2018}.\footnote{In fact, there were reports as early as 2004 \cite{Oganessian2004} that there may have been detected instances of fission fragments resulting from the spontaneous fission of {\Og}, but these are unconfirmed.} To maximize the possibility of detecting SF events as they happen, there is some discussion in the experimental community about building an ionization chamber with the ability to distinguish fragments by their Z-value. This is discussed at some length in \cite{Brewer2018}:

``Among these SF events, there were signals correlated with incoming recoil-like signals within the time range of the 294Og half-life. We have inspected the possible assignment of some SF events to the fission of 294 Og. In the past, as well very recently, 294 Og was considered as a system consisting of doubly magic 208 Pb and singly magic N = 50, 86 Kr. These two components are well bound stable nuclei. One can envision that an asymmetric fission of 294 Og into 208 Pb and 86 Kr fragments might be somewhat enhanced.

``However, especially since the decay time of 294 Og is not sufficiently different from 258 No decay, one cannot make an assignment to 294 Og activity based only on the half-life of SF events. The energy of SF events vary, since we detect sometimes only a partial energy of fission fragments. Such events are more likely to arise from the SF activity produced in a multinucleon transfer involving the Cf isotope in the target. The indistinguishability of complete-fusion from transfer reaction products provides motivation for an ionization chamber, which would have a discrimination capability for the atomic number Z, placed before the implantation Si counter. Construction and anticipated performance of such an ionization chamber based on gas electron multiplier (GEM) technology was recently discussed...''
