%% section, subsection etc., use the starred version; that is,
%% \section*{section name}.  Such subdivisions are not to be 
%% listed in the Table of Contents.

%%%%%%% A NOTE ABOUT APPENDICES %%%%%%%%%

%% instead of ÒBIBLIOGRAPHYÓ if that is the convention in your discipline. 
%% To do so, copy and paste your choice into the empty argument 
%% of the following command and remove the "%".
%\renewcommand{\bibname}{}

%% The bibliography may be made using BibTeX.
%% To do so the necessary commands must be entered in the 
%% preamble and here.
%% If the Bibliography is made from scratch,
%% remove the "%" in front of \begin{thebibliography}{???}
%% replacing the ??? with the appropriate entry and 
%% remove the "%" in front of \end{thebibliography} below.
% \begin{thebibliography}{???}
%%  Enter the bibliography here.
% \end{thebibliography}
%% In either case, the bibliography is automatically entered
%% in the Table of Contents.
\end{document}

%%%%%% FINAL COMMENTS %%%%

%% in the .log file look for error messages beginning with, 
%% "Overfull \hbox ". 

%% Once your document has been filed with the Graduate School,
%% if you wish to produce a single spaced version of your document, 
%% find and remove the commands \begin{doublespace}
%% and \end{doublespace} above.
