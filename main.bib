Illustrative calculations are carried out for one-dimensional quadrupole fission pathways in 256Fm. It is shown that the collective mass exhibits strong variations with the quadrupole collective coordinate. These variations are related to the changes in the intrinsic shell structure. The differences between collective inertia obtained in cranking and perturbative cranking approximations to ATDHFB, and within GOA, are discussed.},

abstract = {The time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory (TDHF) and its adiabatic approximation (ATDHF) are formulated in coordinate space using effective density-dependent interactions of Skyrme type. For this purpose it is necessary to derive the energy density of a Slater determinant without assuming the single-particle states to be invariant under time-reversal. The corresponding Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is obtained by varying the total energy with respect to the single-particle density matrix. With the Skyrme interaction TDHF theory leads to an equation of continuity for the single-particle density. The ATDHF equation is transformed into a finite set of inhomogeneous differential equations. Hydrodynamic-like expressions for the collective kinetic energy are established in case the single-particle wave functions have certain generalised scaling properties. TDHF and ATDHF are applied to the description of isoscalar monopole vibrations in 16O and 40Ca. ?? 1975.},

@article{Schunck2015FTfission,
abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of induced nuclear fission for a broad range of neutron energies could help resolve fundamental science issues, such as the formation of elements in the universe, but could have also a large impact on societal applications in energy production or nuclear waste management. The goal of this paper is to set up the foundations of a microscopic theory to study the static aspects of induced fission as a function of the excitation energy of the incident neutron, from thermal to fast neutrons. To account for the high excitation energy of the compound nucleus, we employ a statistical approach based on finite temperature nuclear density functional theory with Skyrme energy densities, which we benchmark on the 239Pu(n,f ) reaction.We compute the evolution of the least-energy fission pathway across multidimensional potential energy surfaces with up to five collective variables as a function of the nuclear temperature and predict the evolution of both the inner and the outer fission barriers as a function of the excitation energy of the compound nucleus.We show that the coupling to the continuum induced by the finite temperature is negligible in the range of neutron energies relevant for many applications of neutron-induced fission. We prove that the concept of quantum localization introduced recently can be extended to T{\textgreater} 0, and we apply the method to study the interaction energy and total kinetic energy of fission fragments as a function of the temperature for the most probable fission. While large uncertainties in theoretical modeling remain, we conclude that a finite temperature nuclear density functional may provide a useful framework to obtain accurate predictions of fission fragment properties.

@article{Mcdonnell2014,
abstract = {Background: Recent experiments on $\beta$-delayed fission reported an asymmetric mass yield in the neutron-deficient nucleus 180 Hg. Earlier experiments in the mass region A = 190 − 200 close to the $\beta$-stability line, using the (p, f) and ($\alpha$, f) reactions, observed a more symmetric distribution of fission fragments. While the $\beta$-delayed fission of 180 Hg can be associated with relatively low excitation energy, this is not the case for light-ion reactions, which result in warm compound nuclei. The low-energy fission of 180,198 Hg has been successfully described by theory in terms of strong shell effects in pre-scission configurations associated with di-nuclear structures. Purpose: To elucidate the roles of proton and neutron numbers and excitation energy in determining symmetric and asymmetric fission yields, we compute and analyze the isentropic potential energy surfaces of 174,180,198 Hg and 196,210 Po.},

The particle-hole and particle-particle channels are optimized simultaneously, and the experimental data set includes both spherical and deformed nuclei. The new model-based, derivative-free optimization algorithm used in this work has been found to be significantly better than standard optimization methods in terms of reliability, speed, accuracy, and precision. The resulting parameter set UNEDFpre results in good agreement with experimental masses, radii, and deformations and seems to be free of finite-size instabilities. An estimate of the reliability of the obtained parameterization is given, based on standard statistical methods. We discuss new physics insights offered by the advanced covariance analysis.},

@article{Kortelainen2014,
abstract = {Nuclear density functional theory is the only microscopical theory that can be applied throughout the entire nuclear landscape. Its key ingredient is the energy density functional. In this work, we propose a new parameterization UNEDF2 of the Skyrme energy density functional. The functional optimization is carried out using the POUNDerS optimization algorithm within the framework of the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. Compared to the previous parameterization UNEDF1, restrictions on the tensor term of the energy density have been lifted, yielding a very general form of the energy density functional up to second order in derivatives of the one-body density matrix. In order to impose constraints on all the parameters of the functional, selected data on single-particle splittings in spherical doubly-magic nuclei have been included into the experimental dataset. The agreement with both bulk and spectroscopic nuclear properties achieved by the resulting UNEDF2 parameterization is comparable with UNEDF1. While there is a small improvement on single-particle spectra and binding energies of closed shell nuclei, the reproduction of fission barriers and fission isomer excitation energies has degraded. As compared to previous UNEDF parameterizations, the parameter confidence interval for UNEDF2 is narrower. In particular, our results overlap well with those obtained in previous systematic studies of the spin-orbit and tensor terms. UNEDF2 can be viewed as an all-around Skyrme EDF that performs reasonably well for both global nuclear properties and shell structure. However, after adding new data aiming to better constrain the nuclear functional, its quality has improved only marginally. These results suggest that the standard Skyrme energy density has reached its limits and significant changes to the form of the functional are needed.},
