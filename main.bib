abstract = {Schr{\"{o}}dinger-like equation for the nuclear wave-packet. The region of the collective space where the system transitions from one nucleus to two (or more) fragments defines what are called the scission configurations. The inertia tensor that enters the kinetic energy term of the collective Schr{\"{o}}dinger-like equation is one of the most essential ingredients of the theory, since it includes the response of the system to small changes in the collective variables. For this reason, the two main approximations used to compute this inertia tensor, the adiabatic time-dependent HFB and the generator coordinate method, are presented in detail, both in their general formulation and in their most common approximations. The collective inertia tensor enters also the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) formula used to extract spontaneous fission half-lives from multi-dimensional quantum tunnelling probabilities (For the sake of completeness, other approaches to tunnelling based on functional integrals are also briefly discussed, although there are very few applications.) It is also an important component of some of the time-dependent methods that have been used in fission studies. Concerning the latter, both the semi-classical approaches to time-dependent nuclear dynamics and more microscopic theories involving explicit quantum-many-body methods are presented. One of the hallmarks of the microscopic theory of fission is the tremendous amount of computing needed for practical applications. In particular, the successful implementation of the theories presented in this article requires a very precise numerical resolution of the HFB equations for large values of the collective variables. This aspect is often overlooked, and several sections are devoted to discussing the resolution of the HFB equations, especially in the context of very deformed nuclear shapes. In particular, the numerical precision and iterative methods employed to obtain the HFB solution are documented in detail. Finally, a selection of the most recent and representative results obtained for both spontaneous and induced fission is presented, with the goal of emphasizing the coherence of the microscopic approaches employed. Although impressive progress has been achieved over the last two decades to understand fission microscopically, much work remains to be done. Several possible lines of research are outlined in the conclusion.},

@article{Baranger1978,
abstract = {We show how to derive the parameters of a phenomenological collective model from a microscopic theory. The microscopic theory is Hartree-Fock, and we start from the time- dependent Hartree-Fock equation. To this we add the adiabatic approximation, which results in a collective kinetic energy quadratic in the velocities, with coefficients depending on the coordinates, as in the phenomenological models. The crucial step is the decomposition of the single-particle density matrix p in the form exp(ix)p,, exp(-ix), where p0 represents a time-even Slater determinant and plays the role of coordinate. Then x plays the role of momentum, and the adiabatic assumption is that y, is small. The energy is expanded in powers of x, the zeroth-order being the collective potential energy. The analogy with classical mechanics is stressed and studied. The same adiabatic equations of motion are derived in three different ways (directly, from the Lagrangian, from the Hamiltonian), thus proviing the consistency of the theory. One equation of motion (Eq. I) expresses the relation between velocity and momentum; the other (Eq. II) is the dynamical equation. Equation II is not necessary for writing the energy or for the subsequent quantization which leads to a Schrodinger equation, but it must be used if one wants to check the validity of various approximation schemes, particularly when one attempts to reduce the problem to a few degrees of freedom. The role of the adiabatic hypothesis, its definition, and range of validity, are analyzed in great detail. It assumes slow motion, but not small amplitude, and is therefore suitable for large-amplitude collective motion. The RPA is obtained as the limiting case where the amplitude is also small. The translational mass is correctly given, and the moment of inertia under rotation is that of Thouless and Valatin. For a quadrupole two-body force., the Baranger-Kumar formalism is recovered. The self-consistency brings additional terms to the Inglis cranking formula. Comparison is also made with generator coordinate methods.},

abstract = {We describe the fissioning dynamics of Pu240 from a configuration in the proximity of the outer fission barrier to full scission and the formation of the fragments within an implementation of density functional theory extended to superfluid systems and real-time dynamics. The fission fragments emerge with properties similar to those determined experimentally, while the fission dynamics appears to be quite complex, with many excited shape and pairing modes. The evolution is found to be much slower than previously expected, and the ultimate role of the collective inertia is found to be negligible in this fully nonadiabatic treatment of nuclear dynamics, where all collective degrees of freedom (CDOF) are included (unlike adiabatic treatments with a small number of CDOF).},

abstract = {Fragment mass distributions from the fission of U and Pu isotopes at low excitation energies are studied using a dynamical model based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem formulated as Langevin equations. The present calculations reproduced the overall trend of the asymmetric mass distribution without parameter adjustment for the first time using the Langevin approach. The Langevin trajectories show a complicated time evolution on the potential surface, which causes the time delay of fission, showing that dynamical treatment is vital. It was found that the shell effect of the potential energy landscape has a dominant role in determining the mass distribution, although it is rather insensitive to the strength of dissipation. Nevertheless, it is essential to include the effect of dissipation, because it has a crucial role in giving “fluctuation” to Langevin trajectories as well as for explaining the multiplicities of pre-scission neutrons as the excitation energy increases. Therefore, the present approach can serve as a basis for more refined analysis.},

abstract = {Eighty years after its experimental discovery, a microscopic description of induced nuclear fission based solely on the interactions between neutrons and protons and quantum many-body methods still poses formidable challenges. The goal of this paper is to contribute to the development of a predictive microscopic framework for the accurate calculation of static properties of fission fragments for hot fission and thermal or slow neutrons. To this end, we focus on the 239Pu(n,f) reaction and employ nuclear density functional theory with Skyrme energy densities. Potential energy surfaces are computed at the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation with up to five collective variables. We find that the triaxial degree of freedom plays an important role, both near the fission barrier and at scission. The impact of the parameterization of the Skyrme energy density on deformation properties from the ground-state up to scission is also quantified. We introduce a general template for the detailed description of fission fragment properties. It is based on the careful analysis of the scission point, using both advanced topological methods and recently proposed quantum many-body techniques. We conclude that an accurate prediction of fission fragment properties at low incident neutron energies, although technologically demanding, should be within the reach of current nuclear density functional theory.},

abstract = {We describe the new version (v2.73y) of the code HFODD which solves the nuclear Skyrme Hartree–Fock or Skyrme Hartree–Fock–Bogolyubov problem by using the Cartesian deformed harmonic-oscillator basis. In the new version, we have implemented the following new features: (i) full proton–neutron mixing in the particle–hole channel for Skyrme functionals, (ii) the Gogny force in both particle–hole and particle–particle channels, (iii) linear multi-constraint method at finite temperature, (iv) fission toolkit including the constraint on the number of particles in the neck between two fragments, calculation of the interaction energy between fragments, and calculation of the nuclear and Coulomb energy of each fragment, (v) the new version 200d of the code HFBTHO, together with an enhanced interface between HFBTHO and HFODD, (vi) parallel capabilities, significantly extended by adding several restart options for large-scale jobs, (vii) the Lipkin translational energy correction method with pairing, (viii) higher-order Lipkin particle-number corrections, (ix) interface to a program plotting single-particle energies or Routhians, (x) strong-force isospin-symmetry-breaking terms, and (xi) the Augmented Lagrangian Method for calculations with 3D constraints on angular momentum and isospin. Finally, an important bug related to the calculation of the entropy at finite temperature and several other little significant errors of the previous published version were corrected. Program summary Title of the program:HFODD (v2.73y) Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/3b28fs62wc.1 Licensing provisions: GPL v3 Programming language: FORTRAN-90 Journal reference of previous version: N. Schunck, J. Dobaczewski, J. McDonnell, W. Satu{\l}a, J. Sheikh, A. Staszczak, M. Stoitsov, and P. Toivanen, Comput. Phys. Comm. 183 (2012) 166-192. Does the new version supersede the previous one: Yes Nature of problem: The nuclear mean field and an analysis of its symmetries in realistic cases are the main ingredients of a description of nuclear states. For the density functional generated by a zero-range velocity-dependent Skyrme interaction, the nuclear mean field is quasilocal. This allows for an effective and fast solution of the self-consistent Hartree–Fock equations, even for heavy nuclei, and for various nucleonic (n-particle n-hole) configurations, deformations, excitation energies, or angular momenta. Similarly, the local particle–particle density functional, generated by a zero-range interaction, allows for a simple implementation of pairing effects within the Hartree–Fock–Bogolyubov method. For finite-range interactions, like Coulomb, Yukawa, or Gogny interaction, the nuclear mean field becomes nonlocal, but using the spatial separability of the deformed harmonic-oscillator basis in three Cartesian directions, the self-consistent calculations can be efficiently performed. Solution method: The program uses the Cartesian harmonic oscillator basis to expand single-particle or single-quasiparticle wave functions of neutrons and protons interacting by means of the Skyrme or Gogny effective interactions and zero-range or finite-range pairing interactions. The expansion coefficients are determined by the iterative diagonalization of the mean-field Hamiltonians or Routhians which depend non-linearly on the local or nonlocal neutron, proton, or mixed proton–neutron densities. Suitable constraints are used to obtain states corresponding to a given configuration, deformation or angular momentum. The method of solution has been presented in: J. Dobaczewski and J. Dudek, Comput. Phys. Comm. 102 (1997) 166. Summary of revisions: 1. Full proton–neutron mixing in the particle–hole channel for Skyrme functionals was implemented.2. The Gogny force was implemented in both particle–hole and particle–particle channels.3. Linear multi-constraint method based on the cranking approximation of the QRPA matrix was extended at finite temperature.4. Fission toolkit includes the constraint on the number of particles in the neck between two fragments, calculation of the interaction energy between fragments, and calculation of the nuclear and Coulomb energy of each fragment.5. The HFBTHO module was updated to version 200d, and an enhanced interface between HFBTHO and HFODD was implemented.6. Parallel capabilities were significantly extended by adding several restart options for large-scale jobs.7. The Lipkin translational energy correction method with pairing was implemented.8. Higher-order Lipkin particle-number corrections were implemented.9. Interface to a program plotting single-particle energies or Routhians was added.10. Strong-force isospin-symmetry-breaking terms were implemented.11. The Augmented Lagrangian Method for calculations with 3D constraints on angular momentum and isospin was implemented.12. An important bug related to the calculation of the entropy at finite temperature and several other little significant errors of the previous published version were corrected.Unusual features of the program: The user must have access to (i) the LAPACK subroutines ZHPEV, ZHPEVX, ZHEEVR, or ZHEEVD, which diagonalize complex hermitian matrices, (ii) the LAPACK subroutines dgetri and dgetrf which invert arbitrary real matrices, (iii) the LAPACK subroutines DSYEVD, DSYTRF and DSYTRI which compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices and (iv) the LINPACK subroutines ZGEDI and ZGECO, which invert arbitrary complex matrices and calculate determinants, (v) the BLAS routines DCOPY, DSCAL, DGEEM and DGEMV for double-precision linear algebra and ZCOPY, ZDSCAL, ZGEEM and ZGEMV for complex linear algebra, or provide another set of subroutines that can perform such tasks.

@article{Dietrich2010,
abstract = {We formulate a microscopic theory of the decay of a compound nucleus through fission which generalizes earlier microscopic approaches of fission dynamics performed in the framework of the adiabatic hypothesis. It is based on the constrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov procedure and the Generator Coordinate Method, and requires an effective nucleon-nucleon interaction as the only input quantity. The basic assumption is that the slow evolution of the nuclear shape must be treated explicitly, whereas the rapidly time-dependent intrinsic excitations can be treated by statistical approximations. More precisely, we introduce a "reference density" ??P which represents the slow evolution of the nuclear shape by a reduced density matrix and the state of intrinsic excitations by a canonical distribution at each given shape of the nucleus. The shape of the nuclear density distribution is described by parameters ("generator coordinates" q), not by "superabundant" degrees of freedom introduced in addition to the complete set of nucleonic degrees of freedom. We first derive a rigorous equation of motion for the reference density ??P and, subsequently, simplify this equation on the basis of the "Markov approximation". The temperature T which appears in the canonical distribution is determined by the requirement that, at each time t, the reference density should correctly reproduce the mean excitation energy at given values of the shape parameters q. The resulting equation for the "local" temperature T (q, t) must be solved together with the equations of motion obtained for the reduced density matrix R (q1, q2 ; t). ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

While on-going efforts seek to better root nuclear DFT in the theory of nuclear forces [see Duguet et al., this issue], energy functionals remain semi-phenomenological constructions that depend on a set of parameters adjusted to experimental data in finite nuclei. In this paper, we review recent efforts to quantify the related uncertainties, and propagate them to model predictions. In particular, we cover the topics of parameter estimation for inverse problems, statistical analysis of model uncertainties and Bayesian inference methods.

The dynamics of spontaneous fission of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}264{\}}{\$}Fm and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}250{\}}{\$}Fm is explored. The fission paths, action integrals and the corresponding half-lives predicted by the functionals PC-PK1 and DD-PC1 are compared and, in the case of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}264{\}}{\$}Fm, discussed in relation with recent results obtained using the HFB model based on the Skyrme functional SkM{\$}{\^{}}*{\$} and a density dependent mixed pairing interaction. Deformation energy surfaces, collective potentials, and perturbative and nonperturbative cranking collective inertia tensors are calculated using the multidimensionally-constrained relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (MDC-RHB) model, with the energy density functionals PC-PK1 and DD-PC1. Pairing correlations are treated in the Bogoliubov approximation using a separable pairing force of finite range. The least-action principle is employed to determine dynamic spontaneous fission paths.},

Ground state and saddle point properties as: masses, shell corrections, pairing energies and deformations necessary for cross section estimations are calculated systematically within the multidimensional microscopic - macroscopic method based on the deformed Woods-Saxon single particle potential. In the frame of FBD approach predictions for production of elements heavier than Z = 118 are not too optimistic.

abstract = {The mass asymmetry in the fission of U236 at low excitation energy is clarified by the analysis of the trajectories obtained by solving the Langevin equations for the shape degrees of freedom. It is demonstrated that the position of the peaks in the mass distribution of fission fragments is determined mainly by the saddle point configuration originating from the shell correction energy. The width of the peaks, on the other hand, results from the shape fluctuations close to the scission point caused by the random force in the Langevin equation. We have found out that the fluctuations between elongated and compact shapes are essential for the fission process. According to our results the fission does not occur with continuous stretching in the prolate direction, similarly to that observed in starch syrup, but is accompanied by the fluctuations between elongated and compact shapes. This picture presents a new viewpoint of fission dynamics and the splitting mechanism.},

abstract = {The total deformation energy just before the moment of neck rupture for the heaviest nuclei for which spontaneous fission has been detected (Ds279–281, Rg281 and Cn282–284) is calculated. The Strutinsky's prescription is used and nuclear shapes just before scission are described in terms of Cassinian ovals defined for the fixed value of elongation parameter $\alpha$=0.98 and generalized by the inclusion of four additional shape parameters: $\alpha$1, $\alpha$3, $\alpha$4, and $\alpha$6. Supposing that the probability of each point in the deformation space is given by Boltzmann factor, the distribution of the fission-fragment masses is estimated. The octupole deformation $\alpha$3at scission is found to play a decisive role in determining the main feature of the mass distribution: symmetric or asymmetric. Only the inclusion of $\alpha$3leads to an asymmetric division. Finally, the calculations are extended to an unexplored region of super-heavy nuclei: the even–even Fl (Z=114), Lv (Z=116), Og (Z=118) and (Z=126) isotopes. For these nuclei, the most probable mass of the light fragment has an almost constant value (≈136) like in the case of the most probable mass of the heavy fragment in the actinide region. It is the neutron shell at 82 that makes this light fragment so stable. Naturally, for very neutron-deficient isotopes, the mass division becomes symmetric when N=2×82.},

We define the HFB density matrices, discuss their spin-isospin structure, and construct the most general energy density functional that is quadratic in local densities. The consequences of the local gauge invariance are discussed and the particular case of the Skyrme energy density functional is studied. By varying the total energy with respect to the density matrices the self-consistent one-body HFB Hamiltonian is obtained and the structure of the resulting mean fields is shown. The consequences of the time-reversal symmetry, charge invariance, and proton-neutron symmetry are summarized. The complete list of expressions required to calculate total energy is presented.},

abstract = {Background: Nuclear fission of most actinides near the valley of stability is dominated by asymmetric modes with a heavy fragment charge distribution centred around {\$}Z\backslashapprox52-55{\$} protons. Although spherical shell effects in the {\$}{\^{}}{\{}132{\}}{\$}Sn are often considered as a driver for the formation of the heavy fragment, a convincing explanation for the origin of actinide asymmetric fission has been lacking so far. Purpose: To propose an explanation based on the couplings between fission dynamics and octupole deformations in the fragments, with the octupole correlations in the {\$}{\^{}}{\{}144{\}}{\$}Ba region as a driver to asymmetric split. Method: Constrained and time-dependent Hartree-Fock microscopic calculations with dynamical pairing correlations have been performed for a series of actinides to compute expectation values of proton and neutron numbers in the fission fragments, their total kinetic energy (TKE), and their octupole and quadrupole deformations. Results: Deformed shell gaps are present at {\$}Z=52{\$} and 56 in {\$}{\^{}}{\{}142{\}}{\$}Xe and are particularly stable against octupole deformation. Heavy fission fragments are almost exclusively produced with {\$}\backslashlangle Z \backslashrangle\backslashapprox52-56{\$} and a significant octupole deformation at scission. Fragments with {\$}\backslashlangle Z \backslashrangle\backslashapprox54-56{\$} are more deformed, leading to a smaller TKE than {\$}\backslashlangle Z \backslashrangle\backslashapprox52{\$} fragments, in good agreement with experimental observations. Conclusions: Asymmetric fission of actinides is induced by octupole softness in the {\$}{\^{}}{\{}144{\}}{\$}Ba region and not by spherical shell effects in the {\$}{\^{}}{\{}132{\}}{\$}Sn region, except in symmetric fission of fermium isotopes in which both fragments are close to Sn.},

abstract = {The application of Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics has flourished over the past decade, spurred by data sets of increasing size and complexity. In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarized, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

abstract = {Cluster radioactivity is the emission of a fragment heavier than {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} particle and lighter than mass 50. The range of clusters observed in experiments goes from {\$}{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}{\$}C to {\$}{\^{}}{\{}32{\}}{\$}Si while the heavy mass residue is always a nucleus in the neighborhood of the doubly-magic {\$}{\^{}}{\{}208{\}}{\$}Pb nucleus. Cluster radioactivity is described in this paper as a very asymmetric nuclear fission. A new fission valley leading to a decay with large fragment mass asymmetry matching the cluster radioactivity products is found. The mass octupole moment is found to be more convenient than the standard quadrupole moment as the parameter driving the system to fission. The mean-field HFB theory with the phenomenological Gogny interaction has been used to compute the cluster emission properties of a wide range of even-even actinide nuclei from {\$}{\^{}}{\{}222{\}}{\$}Ra to {\$}{\^{}}{\{}242{\}}{\$}Cm, where emission of the clusters has been experimentally observed. Computed half-lives for cluster emission are compared with experimental results. The noticeable agreement obtained between the predicted properties of cluster emission (namely, clusters masses and emission half-lives) and the measured data confirms the validity of the proposed methodology in the analysis of the phenomenon of cluster radioactivity. A continuous fission path through the scission point has been described using the neck parameter constraint.},

abstract = {In spite of their tremendous success, the limitations of current nuclear energy density functionals (EDFs), all parameterized empirically in the form of the local Skyrme, the nonlocal Gogny or relativistic functionals, have become apparent in the past several years. In order to address these deficiencies, a current objective of low-energy nuclear theory is to build non-empirical nuclear EDFs from underlying two-, three- and possibly four-nucleon interactions and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). In this work, the first step towards that goal is taken by calculating the HF contribution from the chiral EFT two- and three-nucleon interaction at N2LO. The density matrix expansion (DME) of Negele and Vautherin is a convenient method to map the highly non-local Hartree-Fock expression into the form of a quasi-local Skyrme-like functional with density dependent couplings. Reformulating the DME in terms of phase space averaging (PSA) techniques, we show that the resulting DME, PSA-DME, is more general and has a significantly better accuracy for spin-unsaturated systems than the original DME of Negele and Vautherin. This is achieved without compromising the accuracy of PSA-DME for spin-saturated ones. Imposing the assumption of time-reversal invariance, we apply PSA-DME to the HF energy from the chiral EFT two- and three-nucleon interaction (at N2LO) and calculate the couplings of the emerging EDF analytically using a combination of analytical and symbolic approaches. Subsequently, we perform preliminary analysis of these couplings and show that their density dependence is driven by the long-range (pion-exchange) part of the interaction. Finally, we discuss the UNEDF semi-phenomenological approach that is attempting to utilize the results of this work.},

Changes in periodic trends due to relativistic effects are outlined for the superheavy elements with nuclear charge Z=111-120.

abstract = {In recent years, several successful applications of the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have emerged in nuclear physics and high-energy physics, as well as in biology, chemistry, meteorology, and other fields of science. A major goal of nuclear theory is to predict nuclear structure and nuclear reactions from the underlying theory of the strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). With access to powerful High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, several ab initio approaches, such as the No-Core Shell Model (NCSM), have been developed to calculate the properties of atomic nuclei. However, to accurately solve for the properties of atomic nuclei, one faces immense theoretical and computational challenges. The present study proposes a feed-forward ANN method for predicting the properties of atomic nuclei like ground state energy and ground state point proton root-mean-square (rms) radius based on NCSM results in computationally accessible basis spaces. The designed ANNs are sufficient to produce results for these two very different observables in 6Li from the ab initio NCSM results in small basis spaces that satisfy the theoretical physics condition: independence of basis space parameters in the limit of extremely large matrices. We also provide comparisons of the results from ANNs with established methods of estimating the results in the infinite matrix limit.},

@article{NavarroPerez2018,
abstract = {We seek to obtain a usable form of the nuclear energy density functional that is rooted in the modern theory of nuclear forces. We thus consider a functional obtained from the density matrix expansion of local nuclear potentials from chiral effective field theory. We propose a parametrization of this functional carefully calibrated and validated on selected ground-state properties that is suitable for large-scale calculations of nuclear properties. The first component of this functional is a non-local functional of the density and corresponds to the direct part (Hartree term) of the expectation value of local chiral potentials on a Slater determinant. A second component is a local functional of the density and is obtained by applying the density matrix expansion to the exchange part (Fock term) of the expectation value of the local chiral potential. We apply the UNEDF2 optimization protocol to determine the coupling constants of this energy functional. We obtain a set of microscopically-constrained functionals for local chiral potentials from leading-order up to next-to-next-to-leading order with and without three-body forces and contributions from {\$}\backslashDelta{\$} excitations. These functionals are validated on the calculation of nuclear and neutron matter, nuclear mass tables, single-particle shell structure in closed-shell nuclei and the fission barrier of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}240{\}}{\$}Pu. Quantitatively, they perform noticeable better than the more phenomenological Skyrme functionals. The inclusion of higher-order terms in the chiral perturbation expansion seems to produce a systematic improvement in predicting nuclear binding energies. This result is especially promising since all the fits have been performed at the single reference level of the energy density functional approach, where important collective correlations such as center-of-mass correction have not been taken into account yet.},

This method stresses the importance of large-scale non-uniformities in the energy-distribution of the individual particles especially near the Fermi energy. The way in which these nonuniformities affect in an essential way many nuclear properties, such as the shape variations, etc. is also discusses. Against this back ground, the behavior of the nuclear deformation energy is described, in particular for larger distortions relevant to the fission process. In this connection, some qualitative singularities of the phenomenological liquid-drop deformation energy at large shape distortions are pointed out, and their possible implications for fission are discussed. As the problems considered cover a wide range of nuclear properties, this paper is not a review in the narrow sense of the word. Comparison with other approaches as well as historic references are given mainly to clarify specific points, because a complete review would be a monumental undertaking.},

abstract = {The production of super-heavy transuranium elements by stellar nucleosynthesis processes remains an open question. The most promising process that could potentially give rise to the formation of such elements is the so-called rapid neutron-capture process, or r-process, known to be at the origin of approximately half of the A{\textgreater} 60 stable nuclei observed in nature. However, despite important efforts, the astrophysical site of the r-process remains unidentified. Here, we study the r-process nucleosynthesis in material that is dynamically ejected by tidal and pressure forces during the merging of binary neutron stars. Neutron star mergers could potentially be the dominant r-process site in the Galaxy, but also due to the extreme neutron richness found in such environment, could potentially synthesise super-heavy elements. R-process nucleosynthesis during the decompression is known to be largely insensitive to the detailed astrophysical conditions because of efficient fission recycling, producing a composition that closely follows the solar r-abundance distribution for nuclei with mass numbers A{\textgreater} 140. During the neutron irradiation, nuclei up to charge numbers Z≃ 110 and mass number A≃ 340 are produced, with a major peak production at the N= 184 shell closure, i.e. around A≃ 280. Super-heavy nuclei with Z{\textgreater} 110 can hardly be produced due to the efficient fission taking place along those isotopic chains. Long-lived transuranium nuclei are inevitably produced by the r-process. The predictions concerning the production of transuranium nuclei remain however very sensitive to the predictions of fission barrier heights for such super-heavy nuclei. More nuclear predictions within different microscopic approaches are needed.},

@article{Staszczak2013,
abstract = {Background: The reactions with the neutron-rich 48Ca beam and actinide targets resulted in the detection of new superheavy (SH) nuclides with Z=104–118. The unambiguous identification of the new isotopes, however, still poses a problem because their $\alpha$-decay chains terminate by spontaneous fission (SF) before reaching the known region of the nuclear chart. The understanding of the competition between $\alpha$-decay and SF channels in SH nuclei is, therefore, of crucial importance for our ability to map the SH region and to assess its extent.Purpose: We perform self-consistent calculations of the competing decay modes of even-even SH isotopes with 108≤Z≤126 and 148≤N≤188.Methods: We use the state-of-the-art computational framework based on self-consistent symmetry-unrestricted nuclear density functional theory capable of describing the competition between nuclear attraction and electrostatic repulsion. We apply the SkM* Skyrme energy density functional. The collective mass tensor of the fissioning superfluid nucleus is computed by means of the cranking approximation to the adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approach. This paper constitutes a systematic self-consistent study of spontaneous fission in the SH region, carried out at a full HFB level, that simultaneously takes into account both triaxiality and reflection asymmetry.Results: Breaking axial symmetry and parity turns out to be crucial for a realistic estimate of collective action; it results in lowering SF lifetimes by more than 7 orders of magnitude in some cases. We predict two competing SF modes: reflection symmetric modes and reflection asymmetric modes.Conclusions: The shortest-lived SH isotopes decay by SF; they are expected to lie in a narrow corridor formed by 280Hs, 284Fl, and 118284Uuo that separates the regions of SH nuclei synthesized in “cold-fusion” and “hot-fusion” reactions. The region of long-lived SH nuclei is expected to be centered on 294Ds with a total half-life of ∼1.5 days. Our survey provides a solid benchmark for the future improvements of self-consistent SF calculations in the region of SH nuclei.},

abstract = {Two major recent developments in theory and computational resources created the favorable conditions for achieving a microscopic description of nuclear fission almost eighty years after its discovery in 1939 by Hahn and Strassmann (1930). The first major development was in theory, the extension of the Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) to superfluid fermion systems. The second development was in computing, the emergence of powerful enough supercomputers capable of solving the complex systems of equations describing the time evolution in three dimensions without any restrictions of hundreds of strongly interacting nucleons. Even though the available nuclear energy density functionals (NEDFs) are phenomenological still, their accuracy is improving steadily and the prospects of being able to perform calculations of the nuclear fission dynamics and to predict many properties of the fission fragments, otherwise not possible to extract from experiments, are within reach, all without making recourse anymore to uncontrollable assumptions and simplified phenomenological models.},

abstract = {Calculations are presented for the time evolution of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}240{\}}{\$}Pu from the proximity of the outer saddle point until the fission fragments are well separated, using the time-dependent density functional theory extended to superfluid systems. We have tested three families of nuclear energy density functionals and found that all functionals show similar dynamics: the collective motion is highly dissipative and with little trace of inertial dynamics, due to the one-body dissipation mechanism alone. This finding justifies the validity of using the overdamped collective motion approach and to some extent the main assumptions in the statistical models of fission. This conclusion is robust with respect to the nuclear energy density functional used. The configurations and interactions left out of the present theory framework only increase the role of the dissipative couplings. An unexpected finding is varying the pairing strength within a reasonable range has only minor effects on the dynamics. We find notable differences in the excitation energy sharing between the fission fragments in the cases of spontaneous and induced fission and we estimate the neutron emission rates before the fragments are fully accelerated.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, through technological, experimental and theoretical advances, the situation in experimental fission studies has changed dramatically. With the use of advanced production and detection techniques both much more detailed and precise information can now be obtained for the traditional regions of fission research and, crucially, new regions of nuclei have become routinely accessible for fission studies. This work first of all reviews the recent developments in experimental fission techniques, in particular the resurgence of transfer-induced fission reactions with light and heavy ions, the emerging use of inverse-kinematic approaches, both at Coulomb and relativistic energies, and of fission studies with radioactive beams. The emphasis on the fission-fragment mass and charge distributions will be made in this work, though some of the other fission observables, such as prompt neutron and gamma-ray emission will also be reviewed. A particular attention will be given to the low-energy fission in the so far scarcely explored nuclei in the very neutron-deficient lead region. They recently became the focus for several complementary experimental studies, such as beta-delayed fission with radioactive beams at ISOLDE(CERN), Coulex-induced fission of relativistic secondary beams at FRS(GSI), and several prompt fusion-fission studies. The synergy of these approaches allows a unique insight in the new region of asymmetric fission around Hg-180, recently discovered at ISOLDE. Recent extensive theoretical efforts in this region will also be outlined. The unprecedented high-quality data for fission fragments, completely identified in Z and A, by means of reactions in inverse kinematics at FRS(GSI) and VAMOS(GANIL) will be also reviewed. These experiments explored an extended range of mercury-to-californium elements, spanning from the neutron-deficient to neutron-rich nuclides, and covering both asymmetric, symmetric and transitional fission regions. Some aspects of heavy-ion induced fusion-fission and quasifission reactions will be also discussed, which reveal their dynamical features, such as the fission time scale. The crucial role of the multi-chance fission, probed by means of multinucleon-transfer induced fission reactions, will be highlighted. The review will conclude with the discussion of the new experimental fission facilities which are presently being brought into operation, along with promising `next-generation' fission approaches, which might become available within the next decade.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Physical Society. Background: The central depression of nucleonic density, i.e., a reduction of density in the nuclear interior, has been attributed to many factors. For instance, bubble structures in superheavy nuclei are believed to be due to the electrostatic repulsion. In light nuclei, the mechanism behind the density reduction in the interior has been discussed in terms of shell effects associated with occupations of s orbits. Purpose: The main objective of this work is to reveal mechanisms behind the formation of central depression in nucleonic densities in light and heavy nuclei. To this end, we introduce several measures of the internal nucleonic density. Through the statistical analysis, we study the information content of these measures with respect to nuclear matter properties. Method: We apply nuclear density functional theory with Skyrme functionals. Using the statistical tools of linear least square regression, we inspect correlations between various measures of central depression and model parameters, including nuclear matter properties. We study bivariate correlations with selected quantities as well as multiple correlations with groups of parameters. Detailed correlation analysis is carried out for Si34 for which a bubble structure has been reported recently, Ca48, and N=82, 126, and 184 isotonic chains. Results: We show that the central depression in medium-mass nuclei is very sensitive to shell effects, whereas for superheavy systems it is firmly driven by the electrostatic repulsion. An appreciable semibubble structure in proton density is predicted for Og294, which is currently the heaviest nucleus known experimentally. Conclusion: Our correlation analysis reveals that the central density indicators in nuclei below Pb208 carry little information on parameters of nuclear matter; they are predominantly driven by shell structure. On the other hand, in the superheavy nuclei there exists a clear relationship between the central nucleonic density and symmetry energy.},

abstract = {Potential energy surfaces calculated with self-consistent mean-field methods are a very powerful tool, since their solutions are, in theory, global minima of the non-constrained subspace. However, this minimization leads to an incertitude concerning the saddle points, that can sometimes be no longer saddle points in larger constrained subspaces (fake saddle points), or can be missing on a trajectory (missing saddle points). These phenomena are the consequences of discontinuities of the self-consistent potential energy surfaces (SPESs). These discontinuities may have important consequences, since they can, for example, hide the real height of an energy barrier, and avoid any use of an SPES for further dynamical calculations, barrier penetrability estimations, or trajectory predictions. Discontinuities are not related to the quality of the production of an SPES, since even a perfectly converged SPES with an ideally fine mesh can be discontinuous. In this paper we explain what the discontinuities are, their consequences, and their origins. We then propose a numerical method to detect and identify discontinuities on a given SPES, and finally we discuss what the best ways are to transform a discontinuous SPES into a continuous one. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Predicting the properties of neutron-rich nuclei far from the valley of stability is one of the major challenges of modern nuclear theory. In heavy and superheavy nuclei, a difference of only a few neutrons is sufficient to change the dominant fission mode. A theoretical approach capable of predicting such rapid transitions for neutron-rich systems would be a valuable tool to better understand r-process nucleosynthesis or the decay of super-heavy elements. In this work, we investigate for the first time the transition from asymmetric to symmetric fission through the calculation of primary fission yields with the time-dependent generator coordinate method (TDGCM). We choose here the transition in neutron-rich Fermium isotopes, which was the first to be observed experimentally in the late seventies and is often used as a benchmark for theoretical studies. We compute the primary fission fragment mass and charge yields for 254 Fm, 256 Fm and 258 Fm from the TDGCM under the Gaussian overlap approximation. The static part of the calculation (generation of a potential energy surface) consists in a series of constrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations based on the D1S, D1M or D1N parameterizations of the Gogny effective interaction in a two-center harmonic oscillator basis. The 2-dimensional dynamics in the collective space spanned by the quadrupole and octupole moments is then computed with the finite element solver FELIX-2.0. The available experimental data and the TDGCM post-dictions are consistent and agree especially on the position in the Fermium isotopic chain at which the transition occurs. The main limitation of the method lies in the presence of discontinuities in the 2-dimensional manifold of generator states.},

abstract = {This review focuses on the field of quantum entanglement applied to condensed matter physics systems with strong correlations, a domain which has rapidly grown over the last decade. By tracing out part of the degrees of freedom of correlated quantum systems, useful and non-trivial information can be obtained through the study of the reduced density matrix, whose eigenvalue spectrum (the entanglement spectrum) and the associated R{\'{e}}nyi entropies are now well recognized to contain key features. In particular, the celebrated area law for the entanglement entropy of ground-states will be discussed from the perspective of its subleading corrections which encode universal details of various quantum states of matter, e.g. symmetry breaking states or topological order. Going beyond entropies, the study of the low-lying part of the entanglement spectrum also allows to diagnose topological properties or give a direct access to the excitation spectrum of the edges, and may also raise significant questions about the underlying entanglement Hamiltonian. All these powerful tools can be further applied to shed some light on disordered quantum systems where impurity/disorder can conspire with quantum fluctuations to induce non-trivial effects. Disordered quantum spin systems, the Kondo effect, or the many-body localization problem, which have all been successfully (re)visited through the prism of quantum entanglement, will be discussed in detail. Finally, the issue of experimental access to entanglement measurement will be addressed, together with its most recent developments.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} World Scientific Publishing Company. The cluster decay process in 270-318 118 superheavy nuclei has been studied extensively within the Coulomb and proximity potential model (CPPM), thereby investigating the probable cluster decays from the various isotopes of Z = 118. On comparing the predicted decay half-lives with the values evaluated using the Universal formula for cluster decay (UNIV) of Poenaru et al., the Universal Decay Law (UDL) of Qi et al., and the Scaling Law of Horoi et al., it was seen that, our values matches well with these theoretical values. A comparison of the predicted alpha decay half-life of the experimentally synthesized superheavy isotope 294 118 with its corresponding experimental value shows that, our theoretical value is in good agreement with the experimental value. The plots for log 10 (T 1/2 ) against the neutron number of the daughter in the corresponding decay reveals the behavior of the cluster half-lives with the neutron number of the daughter nuclei and for most of the decays, the half-life was found to be the minimum for the decay leading to a daughter with N = 184. Most of the predicted half-lives are well within the present experimental upper limit (10 30 s) and lower limit (10 -6 s) for measurements and hence these predictions may be of great use for further experimental investigation on cluster decay in the superheavy region.},

abstract = {A very exotic process of $\beta$-delayed fission of 180Tl is studied in detail by using resonant laser ionization with subsequent mass separation at ISOLDE (CERN). In contrast to common expectations, the fission-fragment mass distribution of the post-$\beta$-decay daughter nucleus 180Hg (N/Z=1.25) is asymmetric. This asymmetry is more surprising since a mass-symmetric split of this extremely neutron-deficient nucleus would lead to two 90Zr fragments, with magic N=50 and semimagic Z=40. This is a new type of asymmetric fission, not caused by large shell effects related to fragment magic proton and neutron numbers, as observed in the actinide region. The newly measured branching ratio for $\beta$-delayed fission of 180Tl is 3.6(7) × 10(-3){\%}, approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger than in an earlier study.},

The latter are defined here as the trans-fermium elements with Z{\textgreater} 100 for which no experimental atomic or ionic level structure information is known so far, and which cannot be bred in high flux nuclear power reactors via successive neutron capture. The principles of suitable laser spectroscopic methods are described, and illustrated by examples of real experiments. The addressed methods include single-ion spectroscopy in Paul traps, laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIF), radiation-detected optical pumping (RADOP), radioactive decay-detected resonance ionization spectroscopy (RADRIS), and ion-guide-detected resonance ionization spectroscopy (IGRIS). With the exception of the first all take advantage of a storage of the ions or atoms in so-called buffer-gas traps. The developed experimental methods can, in principle, also be employed for studying ion-chemical reactions with gas admixtures like O2as well as for performing ion mobility measurements. Both provide complementary information on the electronic structure of superheavy ions. First attempts on this road of research are reviewed as well.},

abstract = {Background: Nuclear fission is a complex large-amplitude collective decay mode in heavy nuclei. Microscopic density functional studies of fission have previously concentrated on adiabatic approaches based on constrained static calculations ignoring dynamical excitations of the fissioning nucleus and the daughter products. Purpose: We explore the ability of dynamic mean-field methods to describe fast fission processes beyond the fission barrier, using the nuclide 240Pu as an example. Methods: Time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations based on the Skyrme interaction are used to calculate nonadiabatic fission paths, beginning from static constrained Hartree-Fock calculations. The properties of the dynamic states are interpreted in terms of the nature of their collective motion. Fission product properties are compared to data. Results: Parent nuclei constrained to begin dynamic evolution with a deformation less than the fission barrier exhibit giant-resonance-type behavior. Those beginning just beyond the barrier explore large-amplitude motion but do not fission, whereas those beginning beyond the two-fragment pathway crossing fission to final states which differ according to the exact initial deformation. Conclusions: Time-dependent Hartree-Fock is able to give a good qualitative and quantitative description of fast fission, provided one begins from a sufficiently deformed state.},

abstract = {This is an exciting time for the study of r-process nucleosynthesis. Recently, a neutron star merger GW170817 was observed in extraordinary detail with gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from radio to gamma rays. The very red color of the associated kilonova suggests that neutron star mergers are an important r-process site. Astrophysical simulations of neutron star mergers and core collapse supernovae are making rapid progress. Detection of both, electron neutrinos and antineutrinos from the next galactic supernova will constrain the composition of neutrino-driven winds and provide unique nucleosynthesis information. Finally FRIB and other rare-isotope beam facilities will soon have dramatic new capabilities to synthesize many neutron-rich nuclei that are involved in the r-process. The new capabilities can significantly improve our understanding of the r-process and likely resolve one of the main outstanding problems in classical nuclear astrophysics. However, to make best use of the new experimental capabilities and to fully interpret the results, a great deal of infrastructure is needed in many related areas of astrophysics, astronomy, and nuclear theory. We will place these experiments in context by discussing astrophysical simulations and observations of r-process sites, observations of stellar abundances, galactic chemical evolution, and nuclear theory for the structure and reactions of very neutron-rich nuclei. This review paper was initiated at a three-week International Collaborations in Nuclear Theory program in June 2016 where we explored promising r-process experiments and discussed their likely impact, and their astrophysical, astronomical, and nuclear theory context.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Much of the research and software tools in derivative-free optimization focus on blackbox optimization problems. These are problems where the objective is effectively a blackbox function, such as the scalar-valued output of an executable-only code, of the inputs. In practice, however, one often has additional knowledge (e.g., sparsity structures, partial separability, nonlinearity, convexity, form of nonsmoothness) about the problem, while still not having access to complete derivative information. This knowledge, which we characterize as defining a greybox optimization problem, can be exploited to reduce the solve time and/or obtain more accurate solutions. On the other hand, when designing software for derivative-free optimization, one must balance the customization needed to exploit this type of information with the ease of use for a nonexpert user. Achieving this balance is especially challenging in derivative-free optimization because of the size and diversity of the user pool, which includes many application scientists and engineers. For these nonexperts, derivative-free optimization is often a gateway to algorithmic differentiation, nonlinear programming, and other areas of structure-exploiting optimization.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}$\backslash$n},

We combine the multi-dimensional minimization of collective action for fission with stochastic Langevin dynamics to track the relevant fission paths from the ground-state configuration up to scission. The nuclear potential energy and collective inertia governing the tunneling motion are obtained with nuclear density functional theory in the collective space of shape deformations and pairing. We obtain a quantitative agreement with experimental data and find that both the charge and mass distributions in the spontaneous fission of 240Pu are sensitive both to the dissipation in collective motion and to adiabatic characteristics.},

We also pay attention to isomeric states, the deformation properties of the fragments as well as to the competition between the spontaneous fission and {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-decay modes. The impact of pairing correlations on the predicted t{\$}{\_}{\{}SF{\}}{\$} values is demonstrated with the help of calculations for {\$}{\^{}}{\{}232-280{\}}{\$}Pu in which the pairing strengths of the Gogny-D1M energy density functional are modified by 5 {\$}\backslash{\%}{\$} and 10 {\$}\backslash{\%}{\$}, respectively. We further validate the use of the D1M parametrization through the discussion of the half-lives in {\$}{\^{}}{\{}242-262{\}}{\$}Fm. Our calculations corroborate that, though the uncertainties in the absolute values of physical observables are large, the Gogny-D1M Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov framework still reproduces the trends with mass and/or neutron numbers and therefore represents a reasonable starting point to describe fission in heavy nuclear systems from a microscopic point of view.},

abstract = {We describe the new version 3.00 of the code HFBTHO that solves the nuclear Hartree–Fock (HF) or Hartree–Fock–Bogolyubov (HFB) problem by using the cylindrical transformed deformed harmonic oscillator basis. In the new version, we have implemented the following features: (i) the full Gogny force in both particle–hole and particle–particle channels, (ii) the calculation of the nuclear collective inertia at the perturbative cranking approximation, (iii) the calculation of fission fragment charge, mass and deformations based on the determination of the neck, (iv) the regularization of zero-range pairing forces, (v) the calculation of localization functions, (vi) a MPI interface for large-scale mass table calculations. PROGRAM SUMMARY Program title:HFBTHO v3.00 Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/c5g2f92by3.1 Licensing provisions: GPL v3 Programming language: FORTRAN-95 Journal reference of previous version: M.V. Stoitsov, N. Schunck, M. Kortelainen, N. Michel, H. Nam, E. Olsen, J. Sarich, and S. Wild, Comput. Phys. Commun. 184 (2013). Does the new version supersede the previous one: Yes Summary of revisions: 1. the Gogny force in both particle–hole and particle–particle channels was implemented; 2. the nuclear collective inertia at the perturbative cranking approximation was implemented; 3. fission fragment charge, mass and deformations were implemented based on the determination of the position of the neck between nascent fragments; 4. the regularization method of zero-range pairing forces was implemented; 5. the localization functions of the HFB solution were implemented; 6. a MPI interface for large-scale mass table calculations was implemented. Nature of problem:HFBTHO is a physics computer code that is used to model the structure of the nucleus. It is an implementation of the energy density functional (EDF) approach to atomic nuclei, where the energy of the nucleus is obtained by integration over space of some phenomenological energy density, which is itself a functional of the neutron and proton intrinsic densities. In the present version of HFBTHO, the energy density derives either from the zero-range Skyrme or the finite-range Gogny effective two-body interaction between nucleons. Nuclear super-fluidity is treated at the Hartree–Fock–Bogolyubov (HFB) approximation. Constraints on the nuclear shape allows probing the potential energy surface of the nucleus as needed e.g., for the description of shape isomers or fission. The implementation of a local scale transformation of the single-particle basis in which the HFB solutions are expanded provide a tool to properly compute the structure of weakly-bound nuclei. Solution method: The program uses the axial Transformed Harmonic Oscillator (THO) single-particle basis to expand quasiparticle wave functions. It iteratively diagonalizes the Hartree–Fock–Bogolyubov Hamiltonian based on generalized Skyrme-like energy densities and zero-range pairing interactions or the finite-range Gogny force until a self-consistent solution is found. A previous version of the program was presented in M.V. Stoitsov, N. Schunck, M. Kortelainen, N. Michel, H. Nam, E. Olsen, J. Sarich, and S. Wild, Comput. Phys. Commun. 184 (2013) 1592–1604 with much of the formalism presented in the original paper M.V. Stoitsov, J. Dobaczewski, W. Nazarewicz, P. Ring, Comput. Phys. Commun. 167 (2005) 43–63. Additional comments: The user must have access to (i) the LAPACK subroutines DSYEEVR, DSYEVD, DSYTRF and DSYTRI, and their dependencies, which compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices, (ii) the LAPACK subroutines DGETRI and DGETRF, which invert arbitrary real matrices, and (iii) the BLAS routines DCOPY, DSCAL, DGEMM and DGEMV for double-precision linear algebra (or provide another set of subroutines that can perform such tasks). The BLAS and LAPACK subroutines can be obtained from the Netlib Repository at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville: http://netlib2.cs.utk.edu/.},

Following the isotopic and isotonic trends of single particle levels, as well as collective features like deformation, may reveal the path towards the gap in the level densities, expected for the next closed proton and neutron shells at the so-called "island of stability" of spherical superheavy nuclei.

abstract = {Penning-trap mass spectrometry (PTMS) is a mature technique to provide atomic masses with highest precision. Applied to radionuclides it enables us to investigate their nuclear structure via binding energies and derived quantities such as nucleon separation energies. Recent progress in slowing down radioactive ion beams in buffer gas cells in combination with advanced ion-manipulation techniques has opened the door to access even the elements above fermium by PTMS. Such elements are produced in complete fusion-evaporation reactions of heavy ions with lead, bismuth, and actinide targets at very low rates. Pioneering high-precision mass measurements of nobelium and lawrencium isotopes have been performed with SHIPTRAP at the GSI Darmstadt, Germany. These have illustrated that direct mass measurements provide reliable anchor points to pin down decay chains and that they allow mapping nuclear shell effects, the reason for the very existence of the heaviest elements. Thus, accurate masses contribute to our understanding of these exotic nuclei with extreme proton numbers. In this article experimental challenges in mass measurements of the heaviest elements with Penning traps are discussed. Some illustrative examples of the nuclear structure features displayed based on the presently known masses are given.},

abstract = {Background: Collective inertia is strongly influenced at the level$\backslash$ncrossing at which the quantum system changes its microscopic$\backslash$nconfiguration diabatically. Pairing correlations tend to make the$\backslash$nlarge-amplitude nuclear collective motion more adiabatic by reducing the$\backslash$neffect of these configuration changes. Competition between pairing and$\backslash$nlevel crossing is thus expected to have a profound impact on spontaneous$\backslash$nfission lifetimes.$\backslash$nPurpose: To elucidate the role of nucleonic pairing on spontaneous$\backslash$nfission, we study the dynamic fission trajectories of Fm-264 and Pu-240$\backslash$nusing the state-of-the-art self-consistent framework.$\backslash$nMethods: We employ the superfluid nuclear density functional theory with$\backslash$nthe Skyrme energy density functional SkM{\{}*{\}} and a density-dependent$\backslash$npairing interaction. Along with shape variables, proton and neutron$\backslash$npairing correlations are taken as collective coordinates. The collective$\backslash$ninertia tensor is calculated within the nonperturbative cranking$\backslash$napproximation. The fission paths are obtained by using the least action$\backslash$nprinciple in a four-dimensional collective space of shape and pairing$\backslash$ncoordinates.$\backslash$nResults: Pairing correlations are enhanced along the minimum-action$\backslash$nfission path. For the symmetric fission of Fm-264, where the effect of$\backslash$ntriaxiality on the fission barrier is large, the geometry of the fission$\backslash$npathway in the space of the shape degrees of freedom is weakly impacted$\backslash$nby pairing. This is not the case for Pu-240, where pairing fluctuations$\backslash$nrestore the axial symmetry of the dynamic fission trajectory.$\backslash$nConclusions: The minimum-action fission path is strongly impacted by$\backslash$nnucleonic pairing. In some cases, the dynamical coupling between shape$\backslash$nand pairing degrees of freedom can lead to a dramatic departure from the$\backslash$nstatic picture. Consequently, in the dynamical description of nuclear$\backslash$nfission, particle-particle correlations should be considered on the same$\backslash$nfooting as those associated with shape degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {Chemical investigations of superheavy elements in the gas-phase, i.e. elements with Z≥104, allow assessing the influence of relativistic effects on their chemical properties. Furthermore, for some superheavy elements and their compounds quite unique gas-phase chemical properties were predicted. The experimental verification of these properties yields supporting evidence for a firm assignment of the atomic number. Prominent examples are the high volatility observed for HsO4or the very weak interaction of Cn with gold surfaces. The unique properties of HsO4were exploited to discover the doubly-magic even-even nucleus270Hs and the new isotope271Hs. The combination of kinematic pre-separation and gas-phase chemistry allowed gaining access to a new class of relatively fragile compounds, the carbonyl complexes of elements Sg through Mt. A not yet resolved issue concerns the interaction of Fl with gold surfaces. While competing experiments agree on the fact that Fl is a volatile element, there are discrepancies concerning its adsorption on gold surfaces with respect to its daughter Cn.

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to better understand the structure of fission fragment distributions by investigating the competition between the static structure of the collective manifold and stochastic dynamics. In particular, we study the characteristics of the tails of yield distributions, which correspond to very asymmetric fission. We use the stochastic Langevin framework to simulate the nuclear evolution after the system tunnels through the multi-dimensional potential barrier. For a representative sample of different initial configurations along the outer turning-point line, we define effective fission paths by computing a large number of Langevin trajectories. We extract the relative contribution of each such path to the fragment distribution. We then use nucleon localization functions along effective fission pathways to analyze the characteristics of prefragments at pre-scission configurations. We find that non-Newtonian Langevin trajectories, strongly impacted by the random force, produce the tails of the fission fragment distribution. The prefragments deduced from nucleon localizations are formed early and change little as the nucleus evolves towards scission. On the other hand, the system contains many nucleons that are not localized in the prefragments, even near the scission point. Such nucleons are rapidly distributed at scission to form the final fragments. Our study shows that only theoretical models of fission that account for some form of dissipative/stochastic dynamics can give an accurate description of the structure of fragment distributions. In particular, it should be nearly impossible to predict the tails of these distributions within the standard formulation of time-dependent density functional theory. At the same time, the large number of non-localized nucleons during fission suggests that adiabatic approaches are ill-suited to describe fission fragment properties.},

abstract = {We review how distinct features of exotic nuclei arise from characteristics of nuclear forces, with a focus on shell structure. Many of those features are not found in stable nuclei, and are related to an unbalanced proton/neutron ratio combined with unique characteristics of various components of nucleon-nucleon interactions, such as central, tensor, two-body spin-orbit and three-nucleon forces. The basics of the monopole interaction are reinvestigated starting from the definition for open-shell nuclei. We discuss how the evolution of shell structure, or shell evolution, occurs due to the monopole interactions of those forces. We survey, utilizing actual examples, the signatures of shell evolution in many experimental observables of low-energy nuclear physics. Those signatures suggest a massive shift of the `magic paradigm', which includes the appearance of new magic numbers, such as 16, 32, 34, etc., the disappearance of traditional magic numbers, such as 8, 20, 28 etc., and other substantial changes of the shell structure, in certain regions of the Segre chart. This article reviews further how combined efforts by theoretical and experimental studies provide a comprehensive picture of exotic nuclei from the shell evolution up to their many-body consequences such as shape change/coexistence, mixing/merging of the shells, intruder bands, weak binding effects, etc. We shall thus see the richness of the shell evolution in exotic nuclei and the resulting diversity of the physics of nuclei with wide unexplored frontiers.},

The collective potential and inertia tensor are obtained self-consistently using the Skyrme energy density functional and density-dependent pairing interaction. The resulting spontaneous fission lifetimes are compared with the static result obtained with the minimum-energy pathway. We show that fission pathways strongly depend on assumptions underlying collective inertia. With the non-perturbative mass parameters, the dynamic fission pathway becomes strongly triaxial and it approaches the static fission valley. On the other hand, when the standard perturbative cranking inertia tensor is used, axial symmetry is restored along the path to fission; an effect that is an artifact of the approximation used.},

For this purpose it is necessary to derive the energy density of a Slater determinant without assuming the single-particle states to be invariant under time-reversal. The corresponding Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is obtained by varying the total energy with respect to the single-particle density matrix. With the Skyrme interaction TDHF theory leads to an equation of continuity for the single-particle density. The ATDHF equation is transformed into a finite set of inhomogeneous differential equations. Hydrodynamic-like expressions for the collective kinetic energy are established in case the single-particle wave functions have certain generalised scaling properties.

abstract = {Background: Applications of nuclear time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) are often capable of providing quantitative description of heavy ion reactions. However, the structure of pre-compound states produced in heavy ion reactions are difficult to assess theoretically in TDDFT as the s.p. density alone is a weak indicator of shell structure and cluster states. Purpose: We employ the time-dependent nucleon localization function (NLF) to reveal structure of pre-compound states in nuclear reactions involving light and medium-mass ions. We primarily focus on spin saturated systems with N = Z. Furthermore, we study reactions with oxygen and carbon ions, for which experimental evidence for {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} clustering in pre-compound states exists. Method: We utilize the symmetry-free TDDFT approach and compute the NLFs to describe {\$}{\^{}}{\{}16{\}}{\$}O + {\$}{\^{}}{\{}16{\}}{\$}O, {\$}{\^{}}{\{}40{\}}{\$}Ca + {\$}{\^{}}{\{}16{\}}{\$}O, {\$}{\^{}}{\{}40{\}}{\$}Ca + {\$}{\^{}}{\{}40{\}}{\$}Ca, and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}16,18{\}}{\$}O + {\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}C collisions at energies above the Coulomb barrier. Results: We show that NLFs reveal a variety of time-dependent modes involving cluster structures. For instance, the {\$}{\^{}}{\{}16{\}}{\$}O + {\$}{\^{}}{\{}16{\}}{\$}O collision results in a vibrational mode of a quasi-molecular $\backslash$alpha-{\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}C-{\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}C-$\backslash$alpha{\{}{\}} state. For heavier ions, a variety of cluster configurations are predicted. For the collision of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}16,18{\}}{\$}O + {\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}C, we showed that the pre-compound system has a tendency to form {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} clusters. This result supports the experimental findings that the presence of cluster structures in the projectile and target nuclei gives rise to strong entrance channel effects and enhanced {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} emission. Conclusion: The time-dependent NLF is a good indicator of clusters structures in complex pre-compound states formed in heavy-ion fusion reactions. The localization reveals the presence of collective vibrations involving cluster structures, which dominate the initial dynamics of the fusing system.},

Asymmetric fission is favoured; the most probable mass division (peak-to-peak ratio) agrees with the experimental data. The lifetimes for spontaneous fission from the ground state agree with the experimental data by order of magnitude.

@article{Sierk2017,
abstract = {Background: Since the earliest days of fission, stochastic models have been used to describe and model the process. For a quarter century, numerical solutions of Langevin equations have been used to model fission of highly excited nuclei, where microscopic potential-energy effects have been neglected. Purpose: In this paper I present a Langevin model for the fission of nuclei with low to medium excitation energies, for which microscopic effects in the potential energy cannot be ignored. Method: I solve Langevin equations in a five-dimensional space of nuclear deformations. The macroscopic- microscopic potential energy from a global nuclear structure model well benchmarked to nuclear masses is tab- ulated on a mesh of approximately 107 points in this deformation space. The potential is defined continuously inside the mesh boundaries by use of a moving five-dimensional cubic spline approximation. Because of reflection symmetry, the effective mesh is nearly twice this size. For the inertia, I use a (possibly scaled) approximation to the inertia tensor defined by irrotational flow. A phenomenological dissipation tensor related to one-body dissipation is used. A normal-mode analysis of the dynamical system at the saddle point, and the assumption of quasi-equilibrium, provide distributions of initial conditions appropriate to low excitation energies, and is ex- tended to model spontaneous fission. A dynamical model of post-scission fragment motion including dynamical deformations and separation allows the calculation of final mass and kinetic-energy distributions, along with other interesting quantities. Results: The model makes quantitative predictions for fragment mass and kinetic-energy yields, some of which are very close to measured ones. Varying the energy of the incident neutron for induced fission allows the prediction of energy dependences of fragment yields and average kinetic energies. With a simple approximation for spontaneous fission starting conditions, quantitative predictions are made for some observables which are close to measurements. Conclusions: This model is able to reproduce several mass and energy yield observables with a small number of physical parameters, some of which do not need to be varied after benchmarking to 235U(n,f) to predict results for other fissioning isotopes.},

abstract = {Background: Recent experiments on $\beta$-delayed fission reported an asymmetric mass yield in the neutron-deficient nucleus 180 Hg. Earlier experiments in the mass region A = 190 − 200 close to the $\beta$-stability line, using the (p, f) and ($\alpha$, f) reactions, observed a more symmetric distribution of fission fragments. While the $\beta$-delayed fission of 180 Hg can be associated with relatively low excitation energy, this is not the case for light-ion reactions, which result in warm compound nuclei. The low-energy fission of 180,198 Hg has been successfully described by theory in terms of strong shell effects in pre-scission configurations associated with di-nuclear structures. Purpose: To elucidate the roles of proton and neutron numbers and excitation energy in determining symmetric and asymmetric fission yields, we compute and analyze the isentropic potential energy surfaces of 174,180,198 Hg and 196,210 Po.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: During the past ten years, the study of retinoids has undergone a total transformation. The Italian Society of Experimental Hematology decided to discuss these advances at a meeting in Florence on April 18, 1996., INFORMATION SOURCES: The material examined in the present review includes articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. In addition, all the authors of the present article have been actively working in the field of retinoids and have contributed several papers. Summaries of their oral presentations at the Florence meeting are reported in the Appendix to this review article., STATE OF ART AND PERSPECTIVES: One of the most important advances has been the elucidation of new molecular mechanisms of control of gene expression by retinoids. A number of new retinoids have been synthesized by chemists, some of which are being screened for potential clinical use, and a few have already had a tremendous impact on clinical practice. The most important achievements have been obtained in acute promyelocytic leukemia. In 1988 a Chinese group working in Shanghai showed that using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) alone 94{\%} of acute promyelocytic leukemic patients obtained complete remission through differentiation of the leukemic clone. This result transformed a dream into reality and allowed researchers to move from laboratory experience to clinical applications of this differentiating therapy. Expanding the spectrum of hematological malignancies that may respond to ATRA remains a challenge; however, several results show some activity of retinoids alone or in combination with other drugs in juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), myelodysplastic syndrome, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and CML. Particularly interesting are the studies that explored the potential clinical synergism of ATRA-based combination therapies with growth factors, other differentiating agents such as vitamin D3, immunomodulators like interferons, or chemotherapeutic agents, in particular Ara-C, all of which show promising in vitro effects when used in combination with retinoids.},

Nevertheless, the search for these nuclei in nature is justified in view of the fundamental importance of this topic. The first statistically significant data set was obtained by the LDEF Ultra-Heavy Cosmic-Ray Experiment, consisting of 35 tracks of actinide nuclei in galactic cosmic rays. Because of their exceptionally long exposure time in Galaxy, olivine crystals extracted from meteorites generate interest as detectors providing unique data regarding the nuclear composition of ancient cosmic rays. The contemporary searches for superheavy elements in the earth matter rely on knowledge obtained from chemical studies of artificially synthesized superheavy nuclei. New results finding out the chemical behavior of superheavy elements should be employed to obtain samples enriched in their homologues.

abstract = {Decay properties of superheavy nuclei are required for exploring the nu-clei from the upper part of the nuclear map. The stability of nuclei with Z ≤ 132 is studied with respect to $\alpha$-decay, $\beta$ -decay and spontaneous fission. Performed cal-culations allow us to conclude that at existing experimental facilities the synthesis and detection of nuclei with Z {\textgreater} 120 produced in fusion reactions may be difficult due to their short half-lives (shorter than 1 µs). We found for the first time the re-gion of $\beta$ + -decaying superheavy nuclei with 111 ≤ Z ≤ 115 located to the " right " (more neutron-rich) to those synthesized recently in Dubna in 48 Ca-induced fusion reactions. This fact may significantly complicate their experimental identification. However it gives a chance to synthesize in fusion reactions the most stable super-heavy nuclei located at the center of the island of stability. Our calculations yield that the $\beta$ -stable isotopes 291 Cn and 293 Cn with a half-life of about 100 years are the longest-living superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability. 1 Motivation More than 40 years passed from the first predictions that the region of rather stable superheavy (SH) nuclei should exist around Z ∼ 114 and N ∼ 184 [1, 2, 3]. Great success was achieved during the last twenty years in the experimental study of reac- tions leading to superheavy nuclei, their decay properties and structure. Up to now near-barrier fusion reactions have been used for the production of new SH elements in the " cold " [4, 5] and " hot " (using 48 Ca as a projectile) [6, 7] combinations of colliding nuclei. The heaviest yet discovered element is the 118 one, synthesized in " hot " fusion reaction of 48 Ca beam and 248 Cf target. However, californium is the heaviest available target which has been used in these experiments for the production of element 118 [8]. Thus, to get SH elements with Z {\textgreater} 118 in fusion reactions, one should proceed to heavier than 48 Ca projectiles (50 Ti, 54 Cr, etc.). The corresponding cross sections for the production of the elements 119 and 120 are predicted to be smaller by about two orders of magnitude [9] as compared with 48 Ca-induced fu-sion reactions leading to the formation of the elements 114-116. Another limitation of the fusion reactions (both " cold " and " hot ") for producing superheavy elements consists in the fact that they lead to neutron-deficient isotopes having rather short life time. The most stable SH nuclei are predicted to be located along the $\beta$ -stability line in the region of more neutron-rich nuclei, which is unreachable directly by fusion reactions with stable beams. In fact, the predicted magic numbers, especially for protons, are quite different within different theoretical approaches. The magic num-ber Z = 114 was predicted in earliest macro-microscopic calculations [1, 2, 10, 3] and confirmed later in Refs. [11, 12]. The fully microscopic approaches predict the proton shell closure at Z = 120 [13], Z = 126 [14], or Z = 114, 120, 126 [15] depend-ing on the chosen nucleon-nucleon interaction in mean field theories. The neutron magic number N = 184 is almost firmly predicted by different theoretical models. Nowadays the experimental study of heavy nuclei, in particular of superheavies, requires ideas, new theoretical predictions, and methods (reactions) that can be used for producing these nuclides. Knowledge of the decay modes and half-lives of nu-clei in a very wide range of neutron and proton numbers (nuclear map) is necessary for such predictions and for the planning of the corresponding experiments. More-over, the study of decay properties may help us to answer some principle but open questions: how far may we still move in synthesis of SH elements by the fusion re-actions, where the island of stability is centered, what are the properties of the most stable SH nuclei, how to reach this region? Another field where the decay properties play a crucial role is the study of the r-process of nucleosynthesis in the superheavy mass region, and the related problem of a search of superheavy nuclei in nature.},

abstract = {Enteral nutrition (EN) via tube feeding is, today, the preferred way of feeding the critically M patient and an important means of counteracting for the catabolic state induced by severe diseases. These guidelines are intended to give evidence-based recommendations for the use of EN in patients who have a complicated course during their ICU stay, focusing particularly on those who develop a severe inflammatory response, i.e. patients who have failure of at least one organ during their ICU stay. These guidelines were developed by an interdisciplinary expert group in accordance with officially accepted standards and are based on all relevant publications since 1985. They were discussed and accepted in a consensus conference. EN should be given to all ICU patients who are not expected to be taking a full oral diet within three days. It should have begun during the first 24h using a standard high-protein formula. During the acute and initial phases of critical illness an exogenous energy supply in excess of 20-25 kcal/kg BW/day should be avoided, whereas, during recovery, the aim should be to provide values of 25-30 total kcal/ kg BW/day. Supplementary parenteral nutrition remains a reserve toot and should be given only to those patients who do not reach their target nutrient intake on EN atone. There is no general indication for immune-modulating formulae in patients with severe illness or sepsis and an APACHE II Score {\textgreater}15.

abstract = {The parameters of the nuclear energy density have to be adjusted to experimental data. As a result they carry certain uncertainty which then propagates to calculated values of observables. In the present work we quantify the statistical uncertainties on binding energies for three UNEDF Skyrme energy density functionals by taking advantage of the knowledge of the model parameter uncertainties. We find that the uncertainty of UNEDF models increases rapidly when going towards proton or neutron rich nuclei. We also investigate the impact of each model parameter on the total error budget.},

abstract = {Background:An electron localizationmeasurewas originally introduced to characterize chemical bond structures in molecules. Recently, a nucleon localization based on Hartree-Fock densities has been introduced to investigate $\alpha$-cluster structures in light nuclei. Compared to the local nucleonic densities, the nucleon localization function has been shown to be an excellent indicator of shell effects and cluster correlations. Purpose: Using the spatial nucleon localizationmeasure, we investigate the emergence of fragments in fissioning heavy nuclei. Methods: To illustrate basic concepts of nucleon localization, we employ the self-consistent energy density functional method with a quantified energy density functional optimized for fission studies. Results:We study the particle densities and spatial nucleon localization distributions along the fission pathways of 264Fm, 232Th, and 240Pu. We demonstrate that the fission fragments are formed fairly early in the evolution, well before scission.We illustrate the usefulness of the localizationmeasure by showing how the hyperdeformed state of 232Th can be understood in terms of a quasimolecular state made of 132Sn and 100Zr fragments. Conclusions: Compared to nucleonic distributions, the nucleon localization function more effectively quantifies nucleonic clustering: its characteristic oscillating pattern, traced back to shell effects, is a clear fingerprint of cluster/fragment configurations. This is of particular interest for studies of fragment formation and fragment identification in fissioning nuclei.},

Taking the heavier {\$}{\^{}}{\{}252{\}}{\$}Cf nucleus (with the available fission barrier from experiment) as an example, the formation of the fission barrier and the influence of macroscopic, shell and pairing correction energies on it are analyzed. The results of the present calculated {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}2{\$} values and barrier heights are compared with previous calculations and available experiments. The role of triaxiality in the region of the first saddle is discussed. It is found that the second fission barrier is also considerably affected by the triaxial deformation degree of freedom in some nuclei (e.g., the {\$}Z=112-118{\$} isotopes). Based on the potential energy curves, general trends of the evolution of the fission barrier heights and widths as a function of the nucleon numbers are investigated. In addition, the effects of Woods-Saxon potential parameter modifications (e.g., the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the nuclear surface diffuseness) on the fission barrier are briefly discussed.},

@article{Neufcourt2018,
abstract = {The mass, or binding energy, is the basis property of the atomic nucleus. It determines its stability, and reaction and decay rates. Quantifying the nuclear binding is important for understanding the origin of elements in the universe. The astrophysical processes responsible for the nucleosynthesis in stars often take place far from the valley of stability, where experimental masses are not known. In such cases, missing nuclear information must be provided by theoretical predictions using extreme extrapolations. Bayesian machine learning techniques can be applied to improve predictions by taking full advantage of the information contained in the deviations between experimental and calculated masses. We consider 10 global models based on nuclear Density Functional Theory as well as two more phenomenological mass models. The emulators of S2n residuals and credibility intervals defining theoretical error bars are constructed using Bayesian Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks. We consider a large training dataset pertaining to nuclei whose masses were measured before 2003. For the testing datasets, we considered those exotic nuclei whose masses have been determined after 2003. We then carried out extrapolations towards the 2n dripline. While both Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks reduce the rms deviation from experiment significantly, GP offers a better and much more stable performance. The increase in the predictive power is quite astonishing: the resulting rms deviations from experiment on the testing dataset are similar to those of more phenomenological models. The empirical coverage probability curves we obtain match very well the reference values which is highly desirable to ensure honesty of uncertainty quantification, and the estimated credibility intervals on predictions make it possible to evaluate predictive power of individual models.},

@article{Eliav2015,
abstract = {High-accuracy calculations of atomic properties of the superheavy elements (SHE) up to element 122 are reviewed. The properties discussed include ionization potentials, electron affinities and excitation energies, which are associated with the spectroscopic and chemical behavior of these elements, and are therefore of considerable interest. Accurate predictions of these quantities require high-order inclusion of relativity and electron correlation, as well as large, converged basis sets. The Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian, which includes all terms up to second order in the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, serves as the framework for the treatment; higher-order Lamb shift terms are considered in some selected cases. Electron correlation is treated by either the multiconfiguration self-consistent-field approach or by Fock-space coupled cluster theory. The latter is enhanced by the intermediate Hamiltonian scheme, allowing the use of larger model (P) spaces. The quality of the calculations is assessed by applying the same methods to lighter homologs of the SHEs and comparing with available experimental information. Very good agreement is obtained, within a few hundredths of an eV, and similar accuracy is expected for the SHEs. Many of the properties predicted for the SHEs differ significantly from what may be expected by straightforward extrapolation of lighter homologs, demonstrating that the structure and chemistry of SHEs are strongly affected by relativity. The major scientific challenge of the calculations is to find the electronic structure and basic atomic properties of the SHE and assign its proper place in the periodic table. Significant recent developments include joint experimental-computational studies of the excitation spectrum of Fm and the ionization energy of Lr, with excellent agreement of experiment and theory, auguring well for the future of research in the field.},

It is then shown that a non-interacting collection of fermions at zero temperature can be entangled in spin, providing that their distances do not exceed the inverse Fermi wavenumber. Beyond this distance all bipartite entanglement vanishes, although classical correlations still persist. We compute the entanglement of formation as well as the mutual information for two spin-correlated electrons as a function of their distance. The analogous, non-interacting collection of bosons displays no entanglement in the internal degrees of freedom. We show how to generalize our analysis of the entanglement in the internal degrees of freedom to an arbitrary number of particles.},

A number of specific numerical methods have also been implemented in order to deal with large-scale multi-constraint calculations and hardware limitations: (i) the two-basis method for the HFB method, (ii) the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) for multi-constraint calculations, (iii) the linear constraint method based on the approximation of the RPA matrix for multi-constraint calculations, (iv) an interface with the axial and parity-conserving Skyrme-HFB code hfbtho, (v) the mixing of the HF or HFB matrix elements instead of the HF fields. Special care has been paid to using the code on massively parallel leadership class computers. For this purpose, the following features are now available with this version: (i) the Message Passing Interface (MPI) framework, (ii) scalable input data routines, (iii) multi-threading via OpenMP pragmas, (iv) parallel diagonalization of the HFB matrix in the simplex-breaking case using the ScaLAPACK library.

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of induced nuclear fission for a broad range of neutron energies could help resolve fundamental science issues, such as the formation of elements in the universe, but could have also a large impact on societal applications in energy production or nuclear waste management. The goal of this paper is to set up the foundations of a microscopic theory to study the static aspects of induced fission as a function of the excitation energy of the incident neutron, from thermal to fast neutrons. To account for the high excitation energy of the compound nucleus, we employ a statistical approach based on finite temperature nuclear density functional theory with Skyrme energy densities, which we benchmark on the 239Pu(n,f ) reaction.We compute the evolution of the least-energy fission pathway across multidimensional potential energy surfaces with up to five collective variables as a function of the nuclear temperature and predict the evolution of both the inner and the outer fission barriers as a function of the excitation energy of the compound nucleus.We show that the coupling to the continuum induced by the finite temperature is negligible in the range of neutron energies relevant for many applications of neutron-induced fission. We prove that the concept of quantum localization introduced recently can be extended to T{\textgreater} 0, and we apply the method to study the interaction energy and total kinetic energy of fission fragments as a function of the temperature for the most probable fission. While large uncertainties in theoretical modeling remain, we conclude that a finite temperature nuclear density functional may provide a useful framework to obtain accurate predictions of fission fragment properties.

The potential energy surfaces and collective inertias of 3640 nuclei in the superheavy region are obtained from Self-Consistent Mean-Field calculations using the Barcelona-Catania-Paris-Madrid energy density functional. The fission path is computed as a function of the quadrupole moment by minimizing the potential energy and exploring octupole and hexadecapole deformations. The spontaneous fission lifetimes are evaluated employing different schemes for the collective inertias and vibrational energy corrections. This allows to explore the sensitivity of the lifetimes to those quantities together with the collective ground state energy along the superheavy landscape. We computed neutron induced stellar reaction rates relevant for r-process nucleosynthesis using the statistical approach and study the impact of collective inertias. The competition between different reaction channels including neutron induced rates, spontaneous fission and alpha decay is discussed for typical r-process conditions.},

We present calculations of beta-delayed and neutron-induced fission rates, taking into account different fission barriers predictions and mass formulae. It is shown that an increase of fission barriers results naturally in a reduction of fission rates, but that nevertheless fission leads to the termination of the r-process. Furthermore, it is discussed that the probability of triple fission could be high for A {\textgreater} 260 and have an effect on the formation of the abundances of heavy nuclei. Fission after beta-delayed neutron emission is discussed as well as different aspects of the influence of fission upon r-process calculations. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the new version, we have implemented the following features: (i) the modified Broyden method for non-linear problems, (ii) optional breaking of reflection symmetry, (iii) calculation of axial multipole moments, (iv) finite temperature formalism for the HFB method, (v) linear constraint method based on the approximation of the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) matrix for multi-constraint calculations, (vi) blocking of quasi-particles in the Equal Filling Approximation (EFA), (vii) framework for generalized energy density with arbitrary density-dependences, and (viii) shared memory parallelism via OpenMP pragmas. Program summary: Program title: HFBTHO v2.00d Catalog identifier: ADUI-v2-0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADUI-v2-0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 167228 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 2672156 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: FORTRAN-95. Computer: Intel Pentium-III, Intel Xeon, AMD-Athlon, AMD-Opteron, Cray XT5, Cray XE6. Operating system: UNIX, LINUX, WindowsXP. RAM: 200 Mwords Word size: 8 bits Classification: 17.22. Does the new version supercede the previous version?: Yes Catalog identifier of previous version: ADUI-v1-0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 167 (2005) 43 Nature of problem: The solution of self-consistent mean-field equations for weakly-bound paired nuclei requires a correct description of the asymptotic properties of nuclear quasi-particle wave functions. In the present implementation, this is achieved by using the single-particle wave functions of the transformed harmonic oscillator, which allows for an accurate description of deformation effects and pairing correlations in nuclei arbitrarily close to the particle drip lines. Solution method: The program uses the axial Transformed Harmonic Oscillator (THO) single- particle basis to expand quasi-particle wave functions. It iteratively diagonalizes the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Hamiltonian based on generalized Skyrme-like energy densities and zero-range pairing interactions until a self-consistent solution is found. A previous version of the program was presented in: M.V. Stoitsov, J. Dobaczewski, W. Nazarewicz, P. Ring, Comput. Phys. Commun. 167 (2005) 43-63. Reasons for new version: Version 2.00d of HFBTHO provides a number of new options such as the optional breaking of reflection symmetry, the calculation of axial multipole moments, the finite temperature formalism for the HFB method, optimized multi-constraint calculations, the treatment of odd-even and odd-odd nuclei in the blocking approximation, and the framework for generalized energy density with arbitrary density-dependences. It is also the first version of HFBTHO to contain threading capabilities. Summary of revisions:The modified Broyden method has been implemented,Optional breaking of reflection symmetry has been implemented,The calculation of all axial multipole moments up to $\lambda$=8 has been implemented,The finite temperature formalism for the HFB method has been implemented,The linear constraint method based on the approximation of the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) matrix for multi-constraint calculations has been implemented,The blocking of quasi-particles in the Equal Filling Approximation (EFA) has been implemented,The framework for generalized energy density functionals with arbitrary density-dependence has been implemented,Shared memory parallelism via OpenMP pragmas has been implemented. Restrictions: Axial- and time-reversal symmetries are assumed. Unusual features: The user must have access to the LAPACK subroutines DSYEVD, DSYTRF and DSYTRI, and their dependences, which compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices,the LAPACK subroutines DGETRI and DGETRF, which invert arbitrary real matrices, andthe BLAS routines DCOPY, DSCAL, DGEMM and DGEMV for double-precision linear algebra (or provide another set of subroutines that can perform such tasks). The BLAS and LAPACK subroutines can be obtained from the Netlib Repository at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville: http://netlib2.cs.utk.edu/. Running time: Highly variable, as it depends on the nucleus, size of the basis, requested accuracy, requested configuration, compiler and libraries, and hardware architecture. An order of magnitude would be a few seconds for ground-state configurations in small bases Nmax≈8-12, to a few minutes in very deformed configuration of a heavy nucleus with a large basis Nmax{\textgreater}20. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Kortelainen2014,
abstract = {Nuclear density functional theory is the only microscopical theory that can be applied throughout the entire nuclear landscape. Its key ingredient is the energy density functional. In this work, we propose a new parameterization UNEDF2 of the Skyrme energy density functional. The functional optimization is carried out using the POUNDerS optimization algorithm within the framework of the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. Compared to the previous parameterization UNEDF1, restrictions on the tensor term of the energy density have been lifted, yielding a very general form of the energy density functional up to second order in derivatives of the one-body density matrix. In order to impose constraints on all the parameters of the functional, selected data on single-particle splittings in spherical doubly-magic nuclei have been included into the experimental dataset. The agreement with both bulk and spectroscopic nuclear properties achieved by the resulting UNEDF2 parameterization is comparable with UNEDF1. While there is a small improvement on single-particle spectra and binding energies of closed shell nuclei, the reproduction of fission barriers and fission isomer excitation energies has degraded. As compared to previous UNEDF parameterizations, the parameter confidence interval for UNEDF2 is narrower. In particular, our results overlap well with those obtained in previous systematic studies of the spin-orbit and tensor terms. UNEDF2 can be viewed as an all-around Skyrme EDF that performs reasonably well for both global nuclear properties and shell structure. However, after adding new data aiming to better constrain the nuclear functional, its quality has improved only marginally. These results suggest that the standard Skyrme energy density has reached its limits and significant changes to the form of the functional are needed.},

abstract = {Progress in the theoretical description of superheavy nuclei (SHN) during about the last 25 years is reviewed with the main focus on their structure and properties. This quarter of century is the period when the idea of deformed SHN has appeared and has been developed. The availability of these nuclei to experimental synthesis and studies of them were a decisive factor in a revival of interest in the studies of SHN, which resulted in great progress in this field. Due to this, also the present review gives main attention to deformed SHN. Theoretical studies, which are based on both traditional macroscopic-microscopic, and more recently developed purely microscopic, self-consistent approaches are discussed. Results obtained within these approaches are illustrated. These are the results on shell structure, masses, deformations, $\alpha$-decay energies, rotational properties, fission barriers, $\alpha$-decay and spontaneous-fission half-lives, and single-particle properties of SHN. The results obtained by different methods are compared with each other and confronted with those obtained in experiment. A chance of existence of exotic configurations, having gross non-uniformities of nucleonic density, expected to occur in nuclei with very large atomic numbers, is addressed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Asai2015,
abstract = {Significant technical progress concerning the availability of intense heavy-ion beams and highly-efficient and sophisticated detection devices has made nuclear-structure investigations possible in the region of superheavy nuclei. Exciting new results have been obtained by applying $\alpha$ spectroscopy as well as $\alpha$-$\gamma$ and internal-conversion-electron coincidence spectroscopy. The present review article gives an overview of the experimental techniques and methods with specific attention to the recent developments of digital signal and data processing giving access to half-life ranges of less than a few microseconds. The presentation of the experimental results and the physics discussion will be focused on nuclear structure systematics in even-Z nuclei along the N=. 151, 153, and. 155 isotonic lines, where most progress has been achieved in the last 10 years.},

@article{Younes2011,
abstract = {We examine nuclear scission within a fully quantum-mechanical microscopic framework, focusing on the nonlocal aspects of the theory. Using Pu240 hot fission as an example, we discuss the identification of the fragments and the calculation of their kinetic, excitation, and interaction energies, through the localization of the orbital wave functions. We show that the disentanglement of the fragment wave functions is essential to the quantum-mechanical definition of scission and the calculation of physical observables. Finally, we discuss the fragments' prescission excitation mechanisms and give a nonadiabatic description of their evolution beyond scission.},

@article{Oganessian2007,
abstract = {After a brief introduction of the role of shell effects in determining the limiting nuclear masses, the experimental investigation of the decay properties of the heaviest nuclei is presented. For the production of superheavy nuclides fusion, reactions of heavy actinide nuclei with 48Ca-projectiles have been used. The properties of the new nuclei, the isotopes of elements 112–118, as well as of their decay products, together with the known data for the light isotopes with Z ≤ 113, give evidence of the significant increase of the stability with the neutron number of the heavy nucleus. The obtained results are discussed in the context of the theoretical predictions about the 'island of stability' of the hypothetical superheavy elements.},

@article{GarciaRuiz2016,
abstract = {Despite being a complex many-body system, the atomic nucleus exhibits simple structures for certain "magic" numbers of protons and neutrons. The calcium chain in particular is both unique and puzzling: evidence of doubly-magic features are known in 40,48Ca, and recently suggested in two radioactive isotopes, 52,54Ca. Although many properties of experimentally known Ca isotopes have been successfully described by nuclear theory, it is still a challenge to predict their charge radii evolution. Here we present the first measurements of the charge radii of 49,51,52Ca, obtained from laser spectroscopy experiments at ISOLDE, CERN. The experimental results are complemented by state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. The large and unexpected increase of the size of the neutron-rich calcium isotopes beyond N = 28 challenges the doubly-magic nature of 52Ca and opens new intriguing questions on the evolution of nuclear sizes away from stability, which are of importance for our understanding of neutron-rich atomic nuclei.},

abstract = {Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations of hot fission in Pu240 have been performed with a newly implemented code that uses the D1S finite-range effective interaction. The hot-scission line is identified in the quadrupole-octupole-moment coordinate space. Fission-fragment shapes are extracted from the calculations. A benchmark calculation for Th226 is obtained and compared with results in the literature. In addition, technical aspects of the use of HFB calculations for fission studies are examined in detail. In particular, the identification of scission configurations, the sensitivity of near-scission calculations to the choice of collective coordinates in the HFB iterations, and the formalism for the adjustment of collective-variable constraints are discussed. The power of the constraint-adjustment algorithm is illustrated with calculations near the critical scission configurations with up to seven simultaneous constraints.},
