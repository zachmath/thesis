\documentclass[]{msu-thesis}
%
% for a prettier, but possibly non-compliant table of contents use the [mixedtoc] option
% for a plain table of contents use the [plaintoc] option
% for a horrendous looking, but possibly required table of contents, use the [boldtoc] option
%
% If you have large tables/figures that need to be in landscape mode, add the [lscape] option

% This is standard fontenc/inputenc for pdflatex
% If you use LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX you should replace this with the fontspec package
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
%
% If the thesis office requires Times, we'll give them Times
% You can experiment with other font packages here if you like.
% If you are using XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX load the Times or Times New Roman font with \setmainfont
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath} 
%
% Load any extra packages here
%
% You must specify the title of your thesis, your name, the field of study (not department), and the year
