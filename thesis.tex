\begin{document}

\maketitlepage %%This command will produce the title page of your thesis.

%% If you wish to include a "public abstract" (i.e.; in layman's terms), remove the "%" 
%% in from of the command \begin{pub abstract} and remove the "%" in front of
%% \end{pub abstract} below. A public abstract isn't required, but might be useful
%% for some readers.
%\begin{pubabstract}
%%Type the text of your public abstract here. A public abstract is optional.
%\end{pubabstract}

\begin{abstract}
%% Type your abstract here. An abstract is REQUIRED and limited to two pages.
%% The abstract must not include any figures.
Historically, most experimental and theoretical studies of fission have centered around the region of actinides near $^{235}$U, which includes isotopes of uranium, plutonium, and thorium relevant for reactor physics and stockpile stewardship. Isotopes in this region tend to fission asymmetrically, with the larger prefragment influenced by the doubly-magic shell structure of $^{132}$Sn and resulting in a heavy fragment distribution centered around ${\sim}^{140}$Te. However, given the nuclear physics community's recent interest in rare and exotic nuclei, we have applied our model to study spontaneous fission primary fragment yields in exotic systems found in other regions of the nuclear chart, including neutron-deficient {\Pt}, superheavy {\Og}, and neutron-rich nuclei with relevance to the r-process such as $^{254}$Pu.

%\begin{acknowledgment}
%% Type your acknowledgment here. An acknowledgment is optional.
%I wish to express my gratitude to Witek, who provided me with direction and with many great and wonderful opportunities to travel and meet new people. I also express my appreciation for the cameraderie he has cultivated within his group through his weekly group meetings, regular lunch outings, and occasional house gatherings.
%
%And speaking of Witek's group, I have rubbed shoulders with many terrific young scientists, many of whom have helped me along the way. Here I recognize Erik, Kevin, Bastian, Yannen, Chunli, Jimmy, Samuel, Nicolas, Rolo, Yue, Nobuo, Futoshi, Mao, Maxwell, Mengzhe, Tong, ...
%
%Samuel, Jhilam, Nicolas
%
%I am grateful for the many graduate students I've encountered along the way. The community of graduate students at the NSCL is (one of its greatest assets?), and perhaps it's unfair of me to single out any individual. Nevertheless, there are 4(?) individuals who made specific, important contributions at critical moments of my PhD development/career. I would like to recognize:
%
%Terri, for being reliable
%Juan, for being relatable
%Wei Jia, for being empathetic
%Mao, for being genuine/my friend/sincere
%
%Other individuals I particularly wish to mention by name include Amy, John, Hao, Becky, and Chris.
%\end{acknowledgment}

%% If you wish to have a preface, remove the "%" in front of \begin{preface}
%% and remove the "%" in front of \end{preface} below. The formatting of
%% a preface isn't specified, but it is included in the TOC.
%\begin{preface}
%% Type your preface here. A preface is optional.

%% If your document contains figures, remove the "%" in front of
%% the following line.
\LOF

%%%% LIST OF SYMBOLS OR LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS %%%%
%% If you wish to have a list of symbols or a list of abbreviations,

%% \begin{symbols} and remove the "%" in front of \end{symbols} below.
%\begin{symbols}
%% Type your list using a list environment here.

%% Similarly for a list of abbreviations remove the "%" in front of 
%% \begin{abbrev} and remove the "%" in front of \end{abbrev} below.
%\begin{abbrev}
%% Type your list using a list environment here.
%\end{abbrev}
%% The list will be included in the TOC as

%% Put the body of your dissertation here. 
%% DO NOT include the bibliography or any appendices.
%% These topics will be discussed later.
\include{./TeX_files/chapter01} % Introduction
\include{./TeX_files/chapter02} % Intro to nuclear DFT
\include{./TeX_files/chapter03} % Numerical considerations
\include{./TeX_files/chapter04} % Two fission modes in 178Pt
\include{./TeX_files/chapter05} % Cluster decay in 294Og
\include{./TeX_files/chapter06} % R-process
\include{./TeX_files/chapter07} % Outlook

%%%%%% LANDSCAPE PAGES  %%%%%%
%% To produce graphics or tables in landscape mode,
%% begin by removing the "%" in the next two lines.
%\begin{landscape}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
%% The contents of the page can be centered using the center environment
%% or the \centering command. Insert either a table with the tabular environment
%% or input a graphics file.
%% Use \captionof{table}{caption_text} (or figure in place of table) 
%% to create the caption for a short table or a figure. 
%% Insert a long table in a table environment. It disables double spacing
%% which is permitted for long tables. Finally remove the "%" from the next line.
%\end{landacape}

%%%%%%%    APPENDICES    %%%%%%%%%%
%% If you wish to include just one appendix, remove the "%" 
%% in front of \appendix below. To include two or more appendices,
%% remove the "%" in front of \appendices.
%\appendix
\appendices
\include{./TeX_files/chapter08} % Appendix A: Fragment ID
\include{./TeX_files/chapter09} % Appendix B: Temperature-dependence of collective inertia
\include{./TeX_files/chapter10} % Appendix C: List of my contributions

%% In either case to start your first appendix, which will be labeled
%% as Appendix A, just type \chapter{<appendix 1 name>}
%% and enter the text of the appendix as you would a chapter,
%% with one exception. If you use any subdivisions, such as 
%% section, subsection etc., use the starred version; that is,
%% \section*{section name}.  Such subdivisions are not to be 
%% listed in the Table of Contents.

%%%%%%% A NOTE ABOUT APPENDICES %%%%%%%%%
%% Some appendices may be single-spaced such as survey examples
%% or letters. See the Graduate School's formatting guide for details.
%% To single space an appendix first remove the "%" from 
%% the following two lines.
%\end{doublespace}
%\chapter{<appendix name>}
%% Insert the name of the appendix.
%% Insert the text of the appendix.
%% Remove the "%" from the following line.
%\begin{doublespace}
%% Any text entered now will be double spaced.

\end{doublespace}

%%%%%%  Bibliography %%%%%
%% A bibliography is required. By default it is called, "Bibliography"
%% You may use �LITERATURE CITED�, �WORKS CITED� or �REFERENCES� 
%% instead of �BIBLIOGRAPHY� if that is the convention in your discipline. 
%% To do so, copy and paste your choice into the empty argument 
%% of the following command and remove the "%".
%\renewcommand{\bibname}{}

%% The bibliography may be made using BibTeX.
%% To do so the necessary commands must be entered in the 
%% preamble and here.
\bibliography{main}
\bibliographystyle{apsrev4-1} % I don't know what bibliography style to use, so this is a placeholder

%% If the Bibliography is made from scratch,
%% remove the "%" in front of \begin{thebibliography}{???}
%% replacing the ??? with the appropriate entry and 
%% remove the "%" in front of \end{thebibliography} below.
% \begin{thebibliography}{???}
%%  Enter the bibliography here.
% \end{thebibliography}
%% In either case, the bibliography is automatically entered
%% in the Table of Contents.
\end{document}

%%%%%% FINAL COMMENTS %%%%
%% Before submitting your dissertation to the Graduate School
%% Make sure there isn't any text in the right margins. To do 
%% in the .log file look for error messages beginning with, 
%% "Overfull \hbox ". 

%% Once your document has been filed with the Graduate School,
%% if you wish to produce a single spaced version of your document, 
%% find and remove the commands \begin{doublespace}
%% and \end{doublespace} above.
