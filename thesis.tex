%%This is the final version of the template I ended up using - your milage may vary.
%%In particular, the class file with this is set up to play nice with the hyperref

\begin{abstract}
Historically, most experimental and theoretical studies of fission have centered around the region of actinides near $^{235}$U, which includes isotopes of uranium, plutonium, and thorium relevant for reactor physics and stockpile stewardship. Isotopes in this region tend to fission asymmetrically, with the larger prefragment influenced by the doubly-magic shell structure of $^{132}$Sn and resulting in a heavy fragment distribution centered around $^{140}$Te. However, fission is a common decay mode of nuclei, both lighter and heavier than the actinides. Given the nuclear physics community's interest in rare and exotic nuclei, we have applied nuclear density functional theory to study spontaneous fission primary fragment yields in exotic systems found in other regions of the nuclear chart, including neutron-deficient {\Pt}, superheavy {\Og}, and neutron-rich nuclei with relevance to the r-process such as $^{254}$Pu.

I first and foremost wish to express my gratitude to Witek, for providing direction, perspective, and so many wonderful opportunities. I consider myself very lucky to have been one of Witek's graduate students.

I would like to acknowledge my fission collaborators, Nicolas, Jhilam, and Samuel. Thank you for your patience and support. I can't stress that enough.

I have been fortunate to rub shoulders with several terrific young scientists as part of Witek's research group, many of whom have helped me along the way. Here I would like to recognize Erik, Kevin, Bastian, Yannen, Chunli, Simin, Jimmy, Samuel, Nicolas, Rolo, Yue, Nobuo, Futoshi, Mao, Maxwell, Mengzhe, Tong, Leo, ...

I am grateful for the many graduate students I've encountered along the way. The community of graduate students at the NSCL is, in my opinion, one of its greatest assets. Perhaps it's unfair of me to single out any individual; nevertheless, there are a few who made specific, important contributions at critical moments of my PhD career. I would like to recognize: 
Amy, for going first;
John, for thinking different;
Terri, for being reliable;
Juan, for being relatable;
Wei Jia, for being empathetic;
and Mao, for being sincere.

Special shout-out to the members of the East Lansing University Ward. Double shout-out to Ethan for being such a good roommate.

And finally, love and gratitude to my wife and family. Melon, Beaky, KJ+N8, Krystal, Xander, Ninrick, Rick Stick, Mom and Dad: Thank you, and I love you.

%% The bibliography may be made using BibTeX.
%% To do so the necessary commands must be entered in the 
%% preamble and here. 
%% Note - do NOT include an extension to the filename below - If your bibtex file is ``BibliographyFilename.bib'', do this: - DMA

%% If the Bibliography is made from scratch,

%% replacing the ??? with the appropriate entry and 
%% remove the "%" in front of "\end{thebibliography}"
